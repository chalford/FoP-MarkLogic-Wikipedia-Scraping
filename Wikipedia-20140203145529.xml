      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1486">'''Queens' Binder''' (or '''Queen's Binder''') is the name given to a small group of English [[Bookbinding|bookbinders]] active during the [[The Restoration|Restoration period]] (1660-c.1700), often called the &quot;Golden Age of English Bookbinding&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name derives from the fact that similar bookbindings were found in the libraries of both [[Catherine of Braganza]] and [[Mary of Modena]]. The term was first coined by [[G. D. Hobson]] in his book ''Bindings in Cambridge Libraries''&lt;ref&gt;*Hobson, G. D. ''Bindings in Cambridge Libraries''. Cambridge University Press, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a convenient term to refer to the characteristic drawer-handle tools and [[volute]]s with [[pointillé]] outlines rather than floral volutes much used by the other binders of the period.

==Subtypes==
[[H. M. Nixon]] subdivided the bindings into three groups, Queens' Binder A, B, and C, due to the slight variations between them.&lt;ref&gt;*Nixon, H. M. ''English Restoration Bookbindings: Samuel Mearne and His Contemporaries''. British Museum Publication, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Queens' Binder A is the most prolific of the three, but Queens' Binder B is considered the finer [[artisan]]. Although the bookbinders have not all been definitively identified, there is strong grounds for considering [[Samuel Mearne|Samuel]] &amp; [[Charles Mearne]], [[Roger Bartlett]], and [[William Nott]] as being at least partially responsible.

==English editions==
[[File:Den ende.png|thumb|right|''Den ende och hans egendom'' – a 1911 Swedish edition, with a foreword by [[Georg Brandes]] and afterword by [[Albert Jensen (anarchist)|Albert Jensen]].]]
===First edition (1907)===
* The first English Language Edition appeared in 1907; it was a translation by the [[United States|American]] [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]], [[Steven T. Byington]] with an introduction by [[James L. Walker]]. The publisher was [[Benjamin R. Tucker]], [[New York]]. This edition was reprinted several times by several publishers in New York and [[London]] up to 1931.

===Libertarian Book Club edition (1963)===
* The 1963 [[Libertarian Book Club]] edition is a re-print of the 1907 Byington translation. Edited by [[James J. Martin]] and with a cover by the son of [[Rudolf Rocker]], the edition revived interest in Stirner as an influence on [[anarchism]] and related ideologies and brought [[Max Stirner]] to a wider audience in the [[English-speaking world]]. This edition was reprinted several times by several publishers in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] up to 1993, sometimes with a preface by Sidney E. Parker.

===Harper &amp; Row - Readings in Fascist, Racist and Elitist Ideology (1971)===
* An [[abridged]] English edition of the Byington translation revised, selected and annotated by John Carroll. [[New York]] / [[London]]: [[Harper &amp; Row]] 1971. 266 pp. The book appeared in a series &quot;Roots of the Right. Readings in [[Fascist]], [[Racist]] and [[Elitist]] [[Ideology]]&quot;, together with writings by [[Gobineau]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], [[Joseph de Maistre|de Maistre]], [[Maurras]]. The text consists of a mix of about a hundred quotations from ''The Ego'' (and some from Stirner's minor writings), reducing the volume by about a half. The reason why Stirner's work was selected for this series remains unclear given the book's fierce anti-authoritarianism and emphasis on the sovereignty of the individual.

===Rebel Press edition (1993)===
* The 1993 Rebel Press, [[London]] edition is an unabridged republication of the 1963 re-print of the 1907 Byington translation by the Libertarian Book Club. The Rebel Press, [[London]] edition has a cover design from [[anarchist]] [[artist]] and [[cartoonist]], [[Clifford Harper]] and a preface by Sidney E. Parker.

===Cambridge University press edition (1995)===
* The [[Cambridge University]] press edition (ed. David Leopold, 1995) is a revised version of the original 1907 Byington translation with a new introduction by David Leopold. Leopold changed the title (His to Its) &quot;not out of ahistorical considerations of 'political correctness' but because [[Stirner]] clearly identifies the egoistic subject as prior to gender&quot; (p. xl). While Leopold accepted the Byington translation as &quot;an heroic attempt to convey the readable yet idiosyncratic prose of [[Stirner]]'s original&quot;, he &quot;made a number of amendments, such as removing infelicities and archaisms, replacing the occasional missing sentence, and restoring some of the original paragraph and sections breaks.&quot; (p. xxxix)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55541">[[File:International newspaper, Rome May 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Newspapers: a global industry in transition]]
'''The decline of newspapers''' has been widely debated as the industry has faced down soaring newsprint prices, slumping ad sales, the loss of much classified advertising and precipitous drops in circulation. In recent years the number of [[newspapers]] slated for closure, bankruptcy or severe cutbacks has risen—especially in the United States, where the industry has shed a fifth of its journalists since 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;E&amp;P0316&quot; /&gt; Revenue has plunged while competition from internet media has squeezed older print publishers.&lt;ref name=&quot;E&amp;P0316&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003951616 |title=Specifics on Newspapers from 'State of News Media' Report|first=Jennifer|last=Saba|publisher=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]|date=March 16, 2009|accessdate=2009-03-17}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://platform.idiomag.com/use-cases/newspapers/ |title=Newspaper Overview|publisher=idio|date=June 28, 2009|accessdate=2009-07-14}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has strictly affected only the United States or the English-speaking markets though there is a large rise in sales for countries like China, Japan and India.

The debate has become more urgent lately, as a deepening recession has cut profits,&lt;ref&gt;Newspapers' ad revenue for 2008 fell 23%, according to the Newspaper Association of America. [http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/newspaperbeat_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003952561]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as once-explosive growth in newspaper [[world wide web|web]] revenues has leveled off, forestalling what the industry hoped would become an important source of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/media/13adco.html?src=linkedin|title=Newspapers' Web Revenue is Stalling|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 12, 2008 | first=Stephanie | last=Clifford | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One issue is whether the newspaper industry is being hit by a cyclical trough and will recover, or whether new technology has rendered newspapers obsolete in their traditional format. To survive, newspapers are considering combining and other options,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/05/newspaper-execs-treading-carefully-on-antitrust-laws/ |title=Newspaper Execs Treading Carefully on Anti-trust Laws|publisher=Nieman Labs|date=May 28, 2009|accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the outcome of such partnerships has been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://platform.idiomag.com/2009/06/the-newspaper-economic-action-plan-a-sense-check/ |title=The Newspaper Economic Action Plan: A sense check |publisher=idio|date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these problems, newspaper companies with significant [[brand|brand value]], which have published their work online, have a significant rise in viewership.

==Causes for decline==
[[File:The New York Times newsroom 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Newsroom of ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1942]]
The newspaper industry has always been cyclical, and the industry has weathered previous troughs. But while [[television]]'s arrival in the 1950s presaged the decline of newspapers' importance as most people's source of daily news, the explosion of the internet in the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century increased the panoply of media choices available to the average reader while further cutting into newspapers' hegemony as the source of news. Both television and the Internet bring news to the consumer faster and in a more visual style than newspapers, which are constrained by their physical form and the need to be physically manufactured and distributed. The competing mediums also offer [[advertising|advertisers]] the opportunity to use moving images and sound. And the internet [[Web search engine|search function]] allows advertisers to tailor their pitch to readers who have revealed what information they are seeking—an enormous advantage.

The Internet has also gone a step further than television in eroding the advertising income of newspapers, as&amp;nbsp;– unlike broadcast media&amp;nbsp;– it proves a convenient vehicle for [[classified advertising]], particularly in categories such as jobs, vehicles, and real estate. Free services like [[Craigslist]] have decimated the classified advertising departments of many newspapers, some of which depended on classifieds for 70% of their ad revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editorandpublisher.com/Article/How-Did-Newspapers-Get-in-This-Pickle-|title=How Did Newspapers Get In This Pickle?|last=Fitzgerald|first=Mark|publisher=Editor &amp; Publisher|date=March 18, 2009 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, newspapers have been pinched by consolidation of large department stores, which once accounted for substantial advertising sums.

[[Media proprietor|Press baron]] [[Rupert Murdoch]] once described the profits flowing from his stable of newspapers as &quot;rivers of gold.&quot; But, said Murdoch several years later, &quot;sometimes rivers dry up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/nov/24/pressandpublishing.business1|title=Murdoch Predicts Gloomy Future for Press|publisher=The Guardian|date=November 24, 2005 | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Simply put,&quot; wrote [[Buffalo News]] owner [[Warren Buffett]], &quot;if cable and satellite broadcasting, as well as the internet, had come along first, newspapers as we know them probably would never have existed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morton&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4416|title=Buffeted: Newspapers Are Paying the Price for Shortsighted Thinking|last=Morton|first=John|publisher=American Journalism Review|date=October–November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As their revenues have been squeezed, newspapers have also been increasingly assailed by other media taking away not only their readers, but their principal sources of profit. Many of these 'new media' are not saddled with expensive union contracts, printing presses, delivery fleets and overhead built over decades. Many of these competitors are simply 'aggregators' of news, often derived from print sources, but without print media's capital-intensive overhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/03/31/080331fa_fact_alterman|title=Out of Print: The Death and Life of the American Newspaper|last=Alterman|first=Eric|publisher=The New Yorker|date=March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimates put the percentage of online news derived from newspapers at 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20471|title=Goodbye to Newspapers?|last=Baker|first=Russell|publisher=The New York Review of Books|date=August 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Newspapers are doing the reporting in this country,&quot; observed [[John Carroll (journalist)|John S. Carroll]], former editor of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' for five years. &quot;[[Google]] and [[Yahoo]] aren't those people putting reporters on the street in any number. Blogs cannot afford it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Richard Campbell, Christopher R. Martin, Bettina G. Fabos|title=Media and Culture with 2009 Update|publisher=Macmillan|year=2008|page=307|isbn=978-0-312-47824-7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Qg_RyIDuQuwC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=%22what+will+become+of+newspapers%22+john+carroll&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Bvt4X013GA&amp;sig=anc0VLOJCdLdgt7woGSa9SWXG-Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mjvDSfbiLomMsAPAtOHlBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result|accessdate=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many newspapers also suffer from the broad trend toward &quot;fragmentation&quot; of all media&amp;nbsp;– in which small numbers of large media outlets attempting to serve substantial portions of the population are replaced by an abundance of smaller and more specialized organizations, often aiming only to serve specific interest groups. So-called [[narrowcasting]] has splintered audiences into smaller and smaller slivers. But newspapers have not been alone in this: the rise of [[cable television]] and [[satellite television]] at the expense of [[network television]] in countries such as the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] is another example of this fragmentation.

==Performance in the market (2000–present)==

===United States===

Since the beginning of 2009, the United States has seen a number of major metropolitan dailies shuttered or drastically pruned after no buyers emerged, including ''[[The Rocky Mountain News]]'', closed in February, and ''[[The Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', reduced to a bare-bones internet operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2009/03/seattle-postintelligencer-to-go-online-only-rocky-mountain-news-alumni-seek-to-launch-own-denver-sit.html|title=Seattle Post-Intelligencer to Go Online Only|publisher=The Chicago Tribune|date=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'' narrowly averted closure when employees made steep concessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/topstories/ci_11914475|title=Workers OK Deal in Effort to Save San Francisco Chronicle|last=Rogers|first=Paul|publisher=Silicon Valley MercuryNews.com|date=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Detroit]], both newspapers, ''[[The Detroit Free Press]]'' and ''[[The Detroit News]]'', slashed home delivery to three days a week, while prodding readers to visit the newspapers' internet sites on other days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2009-03-17-newspapers-downturn_N.htm|title=Newspaper Closings Raise Fears About Industry|publisher=USA Today|date=March 17, 2009 | first=David | last=Lieberman | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]], the state's oldest newspaper, the ''[[Tucson Citizen]]'', said it would cease publishing on March 21, 2009, when parent [[Gannett Company]] failed to find a buyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29720824/|title=Tucson Citizen to Close March 21|last=Rotstein|first=Arthur H.|publisher=Associated Press, MSNBC|date=March 16, 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other large, financially troubled newspapers are seeking buyers.&lt;ref&gt;Some estimate that of the 50 largest daily newspaper in America, 19 are operating in the red.[http://venturebeat.com/2008/06/26/slow-death-of-newspapers-continues-19-of-top-50-us-newspapers-in-the-red/]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few large dailies finding a buyer is [[The San Diego Union-Tribune]], which agreed to be sold to a [[private equity]] firm for what ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' called &quot;a rock-bottom price&quot; of less than $50 million&amp;nbsp;– essentially a real estate purchase.&lt;ref&gt;But despite the purchase of the San Diego newspaper, the deal is unlikely to stoke much private equity interest in the industry, according to'' [[The Wall Street Journal]]'', &quot;as the downward trends the industry faces are too challenging for most firms to want to take on.&quot; While there are a large number of newspapers for sale, &quot;most of them have more liabilities&amp;nbsp;– union contracts, for instance&amp;nbsp;– than worthwhile assets,&quot; notes The Journal.[http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2009/03/19/platinums-newspaper-deal-not-a-trend/]&lt;/ref&gt; (The newspaper was estimated to have been worth roughly $1 billion as recently as 2004.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123740304667774721.html|title=San Diego Paper Lands Fire-Sale Buyer|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=March 19, 2009 | first1=Shira | last1=Ovide | first2=Russell | last2=Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sun Times Media Group]], publisher of the eponymous bankrupt newspaper, fielded a meager $5 million cash bid, plus assumption of debt, for assets last claimed worth $310 million.

Large newspaper chains filing bankruptcy since December 2008 include the [[Tribune Company]], the [[Journal Register Company]], the [[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Star Tribune]], [[Philadelphia Media Holdings|Philadelphia Newspapers LLC]], [[Sun-Times Media Group]] and [[Freedom Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i-ngA_SO-9eGzrcFJmJEV0fUA8mwD96HM8AO0|title=More Newspaper Shake-ups Loom with Chapter 11|agency=Associated Press|date=February 23, 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}} {{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/02/business/media/02freedom.html|title=Freedom Communications Files for Bankruptcy Protection|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 9, 2009 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some newspaper chains that have purchased other papers have seen stock values plummet.&lt;ref&gt;While newspapers earnings have suffered, the value of newspaper franchises has suffered more. Because the equity markets attempt to price future earnings, newspaper share values have swooned because of the uncertainty of their future revenue streams.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[McClatchy Company]], the nation's third–largest newspaper company, was the only bidder on the [[Knight-Ridder]] chain of newspapers in 2005. Since its $6.5 billion Knight-Ridder purchase, McClatchy's stock has lost more than 98% of its value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/03/31/080331fa_fact_alterman?currentPage=all|title=Out of Print|last=Alterman|first=Eric|publisher=The New Yorker|date=March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; McClatchy subsequently announced large layoffs and executive pay cuts, as its shares fell into [[penny stock]] territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10469372/1/newspaper-winners-and-losers-mcclatchy.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEFI|title=Newspaper Winners and Losers: McClatchy|last=Hennelly|first=William|publisher=TheStreet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Although McClatchy faced [[delisting (stock)|delisting]] from the [[New York Stock Exchange]] for having a share price below $1, in September 2009, it was able to overcome this threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchy.com/pressreleases/story/2279.html|title=McClatchy Receives Compliance Notice From NYSE|publisher=McClatchy press release|date=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have not been so lucky. In 2008 and 2009, three other  U.S. newspaper chains have seen their shares delisted by the [[NYSE]].&lt;ref&gt;With three large newspaper chains having been booted out of the [[New York Stock Exchange]], the figure would be higher except that the Exchange eased its listing requirements temporarily because of the global financial crisis.[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/newspaperbeat_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003952561]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Other newspaper company valuations have been similarly punished: the stocks of Gannett Company, [[Lee Enterprises]] and [[Media General]] traded at less than two dollars per share by March 2009, with [[The Washington Post Company]]'s stock faring better than most, thanks to diversification into [[Kaplan, Inc.|educational training programs]]&amp;nbsp;– and away from publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Financial returns on newspaper stocks have been dismal for a decade. An investor who put $100 into the [[S&amp;P 500|Standard and Poor's 500 Index]] would have had $89 by December 2008&amp;nbsp;– a similar investment of $100 in group of the largest newspaper company stocks would have yielded just $18 by year end 2008.[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/newspaperbeat_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003952561]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[UK]]-based [[Pearson PLC]], owner of ''[[The Financial Times]]'', increased earnings in 2008 despite a drop in newspaper profits, thanks to diversification away from publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003946613|title=Pearson 2008 Profit Up&amp;nbsp;– No Thanks to 'Financial Times'|publisher=Editor &amp; Publisher|date=March 2, 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The New York Times Company]], hard-pressed for cash as its shares slid below five dollars per share, suspended its dividend, sold and leased back part of its headquarters, and sold preferred shares to Mexican businessman [[Carlos Slim]] in return for a cash infusion. But the [[credit rating agencies]] still cut the rating on Times Company's debt to [[junk bond|junk status]], and the cash crunch at ''[[The Times]]'' prompted it to threaten to shutter its ''[[Boston Globe]]'' unless workers made deep concessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2009/04/times_co_threat.html|title=Times Co.

One surprising{{according to whom|date=August 2013}} development occurred in mid 2013, when billionaire [[Jeff Bezos]], founder of [[Amazon.com]], paid [[US$]]250 million for ''The Washington Post'' and several smaller newspapers. (The ''Post'' company had sold ''[[Newsweek]]'' a few years earlier.) The purchase, which ended the more than 80-year ownership of the paper by the Graham family, was called &quot;generous&quot;{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} by publisher [[Katharine Weymouth]], who was asked to remain at the helm. When it was noted that the paper might have to run stories which are critical of Amazon.com or Bezos in the future, Bezos agreed not to interfere with the newspaper's independence. Others{{who|date=August 2013}} have said that Bezos drastically overpaid for the paper, and that late publisher [[Katharine Graham]] might{{weasel-inline|date=August 2013}} not have made the sale.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The deterioration in the [[United States]] newspaper market led one [[United States Senator|senator]] to introduce a bill in March 2009 allowing newspaper companies to restructure as [[non-profit corporations]] with an array of [[tax breaks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzgerald&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Article/Senate-Bill-Would-Allow-Tax-Exempt-Status-for-Newspapers|title=Senate Bill Would Allow Tax-Exempt Status for Newspapers|last=Fitzgerald|first=Mark|publisher=Editor &amp; Publisher|date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Newspaper Revitalization Act would allow newspapers to operate as nonprofits similar to [[public broadcasting]] companies, barring them from making political endorsements.&lt;ref&gt;The bill would exempt from taxes newspapers income from advertising and subscriptions. and money spent on news gathering would be tax deductible.

{{update|section|date=June 2013}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], newspaper publishers have been similarly hit. In late 2008 ''[[The Independent]]'' announced job cuts. In January the chain [[Associated Newspapers]] sold a controlling stake in the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' as it announced a 24% decline in 2008 ad revenues. In March 2009 parent company [[Daily Mail and General Trust]] said job cuts would be deeper than expected, spanning its newspapers, which include the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'', the ''[[Bristol Evening Post]]'' and the ''[[Derby Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=CNG.382ffc23908206338768812be3b3f99e.7e1&amp;show_article=1|title=Daily Mail Group to Cut 1,000 Jobs|publisher=Agence France Presse, Breitbart|date=March 23, 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One industry report predicted that 1 in 10 UK print publications would cut its frequency of publication in half, go online only or shut in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/5/articles/533044.php|title=Journalism Job Losses: Tracking Cuts Across the Industry|publisher=journalism.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Across the world===
[[File:Street Scene - Salta - Argentina.jpg|250px|thumb|Newspaper market in [[Salta city]] ([[Argentina]])]]
The challenges facing the industry are not limited to the United States, or even English-speaking markets. Newspapers in Switzerland and the Netherlands, for instance, have lost half of their classified advertising to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=7830218|title=Who Killed the Newspaper?|publisher=The Economist|date=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its annual convention&lt;ref&gt;In the [[United States]] in February 2009, the annual [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] announced they were cancelling their annual convention due to the industry meltdown. In making the announcement, ASNE President Charlotte Hall, editor of [[The Orlando Sentinel]] said, &quot;this is an industry in crisis.&quot; The only previous cancellation of an ASNE annual convention since the group's creation in 1923 was in 1945. Since 1945 the industry has weathered 10 national economic recessions.[http://www.asne.org/index.cfm?id=7268][http://www.newsweek.com/id/186885]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; slated for May, 2009, in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], the [[World Association of Newspapers]] has titled the convention's subject &quot;Newspapers Focus on Print &amp; Advertising Revenues in Difficult Times.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wan-press.org/print.php3?id_article=18041|title=Newspapers Focus on Print &amp; Advertising Revenue in Difficult Times|publisher=World Association of Newspapers|location=Paris, France|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, the World Association of Newspapers called for regulators to block a proposed Google–[[Yahoo]] advertising partnership, calling it a threat to newspaper industry revenues worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;In an interesting twist, the [[Newspaper Association of America]], a member of the World Association of Newspapers but representing 90% of American newspaper publishers, declined to endorse the WAN objections to the Google-Yahoo pact.&lt;/ref&gt; The WAN painted a stark picture of the threat posed to newspapers by the search engine giants. &quot;Perhaps never in the history of newspaper publishing has a single, commercial entity threatened to exert this much control over the destiny of the press,&quot; said the Paris-based global newspaper organization of the proposed pact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/newspapers-worldwide-minus-us-oppose-google-yahoo-deal/|title=Newspapers Worldwide (Minus U.S.) Oppose Google-Yahoo Deal|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 15, 2008 | first=Miguel | last=Helft | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But there are bright spots in the world market for newspapers. At its 2008 convention, held in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]], the World Association of Newspapers released figures showing newspaper circulations and advertising had actually climbed in the previous year. Newspaper sales were up nearly 2.6% the previous year, and up 9.4% over the past five years. Free daily newspapers, noted the WAN, accounted for nearly 7% of all global newspaper circulation&amp;nbsp;– and a whopping 23% of European newspaper circulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Local&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/12180/20080602/|title=Newspapers see sales and ad revenue climb|publisher=The Local, Sweden's News in English|date=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the world's 100 best–selling daily newspapers, 74 are published in Asia&amp;nbsp;– with China, Japan and India accounting for 62 of those.

Sales of newspapers rose in [[Latin America]], [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]], but fell in other regions of the world, including [[Western Europe]], where the proliferation of free dailies helped bolster overall circulation figures. While internet revenues are rising for the industry, the bulk of its web revenues come from a few areas, with most revenue generated in the United States, [[western Europe]] and Asia–Pacific region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Local&quot; /&gt;

==Technological change==
The increasing use of the internet search function, primarily through large engines such as [[Google]], has also changed the habits of readers.&lt;ref&gt;Google's CEO Eric Schmidt recently revealed that the company had considered, but then abandoned, the thought of purchasing a newspaper itself or using its charitable arm to support news businesses seeking non-profit status. [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2252e92c-4569-11de-b6c8-00144feabdc0.html?nclick_check=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of perusing general interest publications, such as newspapers, readers are more likely to seek particular writers, blogs or sources of information through targeted searches, rendering the agglomeration of newspapers increasingly irrelevant. &quot;Power is shifting to the individual journalist from the news outlet with more people seeking out names through search, e-mail, blogs and social media,&quot; the industry publication ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' noted in summarizing a recent study from the [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]] foundation.&lt;ref name=&quot;E&amp;P0316&quot;/&gt;

&quot;When we go online,&quot; writes [[columnist]] [[Nicholas Kristof]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', &quot;each of us is our own editor, our own gatekeeper.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/opinion/19kristof.html?ref=opinion|title=The Daily Me, Nicholas Kristof|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 18, 2009 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where once the ability to disseminate information was restricted to those with printing presses or broadcast mechanisms, the internet has enabled thousands of individual commentators to communicate directly with others through blogs or instant message services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2134918/|title=Not Just Another Column About Blogging: What Newspaper History Says About Newspaper Future, Jack Shafer, Salon, January 26, 2006, salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even open journalism projects like Wikipedia have contributed to the reordering of the media landscape, as readers are no longer restricted to established print organs for information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bal-to.ratner17mar17,0,1115467.column|title='Wikipedia Revolution' United Users on Internet|last=Ratner|first=Andrew|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|date=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the search engine experience has left some newspaper proprietors cold. &quot;The aggregators and plagiarists will soon have to pay a price for the co-opting of our content,&quot; Rupert Murdoch told the World Media Summit in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. &quot;If we do not take advantage of the current movement toward paid content, it will be the content creators&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the people in this hall&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; who will pay the ultimate price and the content kleptomaniacs who triumph.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/online/murdoch-blasts-search-engine-kleptomaniacs-1800569.html|title=Murdoch Blasts Search Engine 'Kleptomaniacs', Alistair Dawber, The Independent, October 10, 2009, independent.co.uk | location=London | date=October 10, 2009 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the newspaper as a medium also argue that while today's newspapers may appear visually different from their predecessors a century ago, in many respects they have changed little and have failed to keep pace with changes in society. The technology revolution has meant that readers accustomed to waiting for a daily newspaper can now receive up-to-the-minute updates from web portals, bloggers and new services such as [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10196386-93.html|title=News Has a Bright Future, Author Says|publisher=CNET News, cnet.com|last=Terdiman|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Terdiman|date=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expanding reach of broadband internet access means such updates have become commonplace for many users, especially the more affluent, an audience cultivated by advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegie.org/publications/carnegie-reporter/single/view/article/item/124/|title=Abandoning the News, Carnegie Reporter, Carnegie Corporation of New York, carnegie.org |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gloomy outlook is not universal. In some countries, such as [[India]], the newspaper remains more popular than internet and broadcast media. Even where the problems are felt most keenly, in North America and Europe, there have been recent success stories, such as the dramatic rise of [[free daily newspapers]], like those of [[Sweden]]'s [[Metro International]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_27/b3941024.htm|title=Net to Newspapers: Drop Dead|publisher=Business Week|date=July 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as papers targeted towards the [[Hispanic]] market, local weekly shoppers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-myers/is-there-a-future-for-new_b_138043.html|title=Is There a Future for Newspapers?|last=Myers|first=Jack|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so-called [[Local news|hyperlocal news]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;refer=home&amp;sid=a0Pd70fy5qXE|title=Google Executive, N.Y. Times Wrestle in New Jersey for Local Ads|last=Mullaney|first=Tim|publisher=Bloomberg.com|date=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But these new revenue streams, such as that from newspapers' proprietary web sites, are often a fraction of the sums generated by the previous advertisement- and circulation-driven revenue streams, and so newspapers have been forced to curtail their overhead while simultaneously trying to entice new users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7878090.stm|title=Economy 'Threatens' News Accuracy|publisher=BBC News|date=February 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With revenues plummeting, many newspapers have slashed news bureaus and journalists, while still attempting to publish compelling content&amp;nbsp;– much of it more interactive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/03/AR2006120301037.html|title=A Newspaper Chain Sees Its Future, And It's Online and Hyper-Local|last=Ahrens|first=Frank|publisher=The Washington Post|date=December 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; more lifestyle-driven and more celebrity-conscious.

In response to falling ad revenues and plunging circulation, many newspapers have cut staff as well as editorial content, and in a [[vicious cycle]], those cuts often spur more and deeper circulation declines—triggering more loss of ad revenues. &quot;No industry can cut its way to future success,&quot; says industry analyst John Morton. &quot;At some point the business must improve.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morton&quot;/&gt;

Overall, in the United States, average [[operating profit margin]]s for newspapers remain at 11%.&lt;ref&gt;The troubles in the U.S. newspaper market, while acute, aren't universal. Large newspapers are suffering more than small. &quot;The great majority of America's 1200 daily newspapers are doing pretty well,&quot; notes [[Editor &amp; Publisher]] editor Mark Fitzgerald. &quot;Even some of the big papers in the most troubled chains are still churning out profit margins in the high teens. That's three or four times the margins of [[Exxon Mobil]].[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/newspaperbeat_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003952561]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But that figure is falling rapidly, and in many cases is inadequate to service the debt that some newspaper companies took on during better times.&lt;ref name=&quot;E&amp;P0316&quot; /&gt; And while circulation has dropped 2% annually for years, that decline has accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/business/media/28circ.html|title=Newspaper Circulation Continues to Decline Rapidly|last=Perez-Pena|first=Richard|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circulation decline, coupled with a 23% drop in 2008 newspaper ad revenues, have proven a double whammy for some newspaper chains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzgerald&quot; /&gt; Combined with the current recession, the cloudy outlook for future profits has meant that many newspapers put on the block have been unable to find buyers, who remain concerned with increasing competition, dwindling profits and a business model that seems increasingly antiquated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/08/06/100141340/|title=Can the Washington Post Survive?|last=Gunther|first=Marc|publisher=Fortune Magazine, money.cnn.com|date=July 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;As succeeding generations grow up with the Web and lose the habit of reading print,&quot; noted ''[[The Columbia Journalism Review]]'' in 2007, &quot;it seems improbable that newspapers can survive with a cost structure at least 50% higher than their nimbler and cheaper Internet competitors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/cover_story/the_race.php|title=The Race|last=Kuttner|first=Robert|publisher=Columbia Journalism Review|date=March–April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem facing newspapers is generational: while in 2005 an estimated 70% of older Americans read a newspaper daily, fewer than 20% of younger Americans did.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18516|title=The End of News?|last=Massing|first=Michael|publisher=The New York Review of Books|date=December 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;It is the fundamental problem facing the industry,&quot; writes newspaper analyst Morton. &quot;It's probably not going away. And no one has figured a way out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Massing&quot; /&gt;

==Financial strategies==
While newspaper companies continue to produce much of the award-winning journalism, consumers of that journalism are less willing to pay for it in a world where information on the web is plentiful and free. Plans for web-based subscription services have largely faltered, with the exception of financial outlets like ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', which have been able to generate substantial revenues from subscribers whose subscriptions are often underwritten by corporate employers. (Subscriptions to the Journal's paid website were up 7% in 2008.) Some general-interest newspapers, even high-profile papers like ''[[The New York Times]]'', have been forced to drop paid internet subscription services. ''Times Select'', the ''Times'''s pay service, lasted for exactly two years before the company abandoned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/business/media/18times.html|title=Times to Stop Charging for Parts of Its Web Site|last=Perez-Pena|first=Richard|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 18, 2007|accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the industry, there is little consensus on the best strategy for survival. Some pin their hopes on new technologies such as [[e-paper]] or radical revisions of the newspaper such as the [[Daily Me]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/opinion/19kristof.html?_r=1|title=The Daily Me|last= Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; others, like a recent cover story in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, have advocated a system that includes both subscriptions as well as micro-payments for individual stories.&lt;ref name=TIME0205&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1877191,00.html|title=How to Save Your Newspaper|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 5, 2009|accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5147184/how-not-to-save-newspapers|title=How Not to Save Newspapers|last=Thomas|first=Owen|publisher=ValleyWag, Gawker.com|date=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some newspaper analysts believe the wisest move is embracing the Internet, and exploiting the considerable [[brand|brand value]] and consumer trust that newspapers have built over decades. But revenues from online editions have come nowhere near matching previous print income from circulation and advertising sales, since they get only about one-tenth to one-twentieth the revenue for a web reader that they do for a print reader;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2154678/|title=Chronicle of the Newspaper Death Foretold|last=Shafer|first=Jack|publisher=Slate|date=November 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
many struggle to maintain their previous levels of reporting amidst eroding profits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirschorn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200901/new-york-times|title=End Times|last=Hirschorn|first=Michael|publisher=The Atlantic|date=January–February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With profits falling, many newspapers have cut back on their most expensive reporting projects&amp;nbsp;– overseas bureaus and investigative journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/03/22/america/letter.php|title=Letter from Washington: A Vibrant Democracy Requires Newspapers|last=Hunt|first=Albert R.|publisher=Bloomberg News, The International Herald Tribune|date=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some investigative projects often take months, with their payoff uncertain. In the past, larger newspapers often devoted a portion of their editorial budget to such efforts, but with ad dollars drying up, many papers are looking closer at the productivity of individual reporters, and judging speculative investments in investigative reports as non-essential.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1821376,00.html|title=The Nightly News, Not for Profit|publisher=Time magazine|date=July 9, 2008 | accessdate=May 3, 2010 | first=Gilbert | last=Cruz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some advocates have suggested that instead of investigative reports funded by newspapers, that non-profit foundations pick up the slack. The new non-profit [[ProPublica]], a $10–million–a–year foundation devoted solely to investigative reporting and overseen by former ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' editor Paul Steiger, for instance, hopes that its 18 reporters will be able to release their investigative reports free, courtesy of partnerships with such outlets as'' [[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'' and ''[[60 Minutes]]''. The [[Huffington Post]] also announced that it would set aside funds for investigative reporting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/29/AR2009032901097.html?hpid=moreheadlines Huffington Plans Investigative Journalism Venture, David Bauder, The Washington Post, March 29, 2009]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other industry observers are now clamoring for [[government subsidies]] to the newspaper industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090406/nichols_mcchesney/4|title=The Death and Life of Great American Newspapers|last=Nichols|first=John|coauthors=Robert W. McChensey|publisher=The Nation|date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observers point out that the reliability and accountability of newspapers is being replaced by a sea of anonymous bloggers, many with uncertain credentials and points of view. Where once the reader of a daily newspaper might consume reporting, for instance, by an established Cairo bureau chief for a major newspaper, today that same reader might be directed by a search engine to an anonymous blogger with cloudy allegiances, training or ability.&lt;ref&gt;In response to charges of lack of credentials or unverified reporting, bloggers often point to their role in examining the reporting of [[New York Times]] reporter [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], whose early reporting on the events leading to the war in Iraq went largely unchallenged in mainstream media. &quot;In the run up to the Iraq war,&quot; says [[Arianna Huffington]] of the eponymous [[The Huffington Post]], &quot;many in the mainstream media , including The New York Times, lost their veneer of unassailable trustworthiness for many readers and viewers, and it became clear that new media sources could be trusted&amp;nbsp;– and indeed are often much quicker a correcting mistakes than old media sources.&quot; [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/03/31/080331fa_fact_alterman?currentPage=all]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, these dilemmas facing the newspaper industry come as its product has never been more sought-after. &quot;The peculiar fact about the current crisis,&quot; writes ''[[The New Yorker]]'''s economics writer [[James Surowiecki]], &quot;is that even as big papers have become less profitable they've arguably become more popular.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2008/12/22/081222ta_talk_surowiecki|title=News You Can Lose|last=Surowiecki|first=James|publisher=The New Yorker|date=December 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the demand for news has exploded, so have consumers of the output of newspapers. (Both [[nytimes.com]] and [[washingtonpost.com]], for instance, rank among the top 20 global news sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massing&quot; /&gt; But those consumers are now reading newspapers online for free, and although newspapers have been able to convert some of that viewership into ad dollars, it is a trickle compared to previous sources. At most newspapers, web advertising accounts for only 10–15% of revenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzgerald&quot; /&gt;

Some observers have compared the dilemma to that faced by the music industry. &quot;What's going on in the news business is a lot like what's happening with music,&quot; said editor [[Paul Steiger]], a 43–year journalism veteran, who further added that free distribution of content through the internet has caused &quot;a total collapse of the business model.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot; /&gt;

The revenue streams that newspapers counted on to subsidize their product have changed irrevocably: in 2008, according to a study by the [[Pew Research Center]], more people in the United States got their news for free on the internet than paid for it by buying a newspaper or magazine. &quot;With newspapers entering bankruptcy even as their audience grows, the threat is not just to the companies that own them, but also the news itself,&quot; observed writer [[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in a January 2009 column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1877191-4,00.html|title=How to Save Your Newspaper|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|publisher=Time magazine|date=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outlook for the future==
Ultimately, the newspaper of the future may bear little resemblance to the [[newsprint]] edition familiar to older readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/feature/overload_1.php?page=all|title=Overload!, Journalism's Battle for Relevance in an Age of Too Much Information|last=Nordenson|first=Bree|publisher=Columbia Journalism Review|date=November–December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may become a hybrid, part-print and part-internet, or perhaps eventually, as has happened with several newspapers, including the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' and the ''[[Ann Arbor News]]'', internet only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/403793_piclosure17.html|title=Seattle P-I to Publish Last Edition Tuesday|publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=March 17, 2009|first1=Dan|last1=Richman|first2=Andrea|last2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/business/media/24paper.html?ref=business|title=4 Michigan Markets Will Lose Daily Newspapers, As Ailing Industry Tries to Cope|last=Perez-Pena|first=Richard|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the transition from the printed page to whatever comes next will likely be fraught with challenges, both for the newspaper industry and for its consumers.

&quot;My expectation,&quot; wrote [[executive editor]] [[Bill Keller]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in January 2009, &quot;is that for the foreseeable future our business will continue to be a mix of print and online journalism, with the growth online offsetting the (gradual, we hope) decline of print.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/business/media/02askthetimes.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Talk to the Newsroom: Executive Editor|publisher=The New York Times|date=January 28, 2009 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[paper]] in newspaper may go away, insist industry stalwarts, but the news will remain. &quot;Paper is dying,&quot; said Nick Bilton, a technologist for ''[[The New York Times|The Times]]'', &quot;but it's just a device. Replacing it with pixels is a better experience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/03/the-future-of-n.html|title=Times Techie Envisions The Future of News|publisher=Wired Magazine, blog.wired.com | first=Ryan|last=Singel|date=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 8, 2010, [[Arthur Sulzberger Jr.]], Chairman and Publisher of [[The New York Times]], told an International Newsroom Summit in London that &quot;We will stop printing the New York Times sometime in the future, date TBD.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arthur Sulzberger: 'We Will Stop Printing The New York Times Sometime In The Future' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/09/arthur-sulzberger-we-will_n_710251.html  |first=  Danny|last= Shea|date=September 10, 2010 |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But even as pixels replace print, and as newspapers undergo wrenching surgery, necessitating deep cutbacks, reallocation of remaining reporters, and the slashing of decades-old overhead, some observers remain optimistic.&lt;ref&gt;Even as large newspapers for sale in the United States have been unable to find buyers, the market for smaller community newspapers, which have faced less online competition, has held up better.[http://www.forbes.com/2008/04/07/newspapers-advertising-biz-media-cx_lh_0407papers.html] In general, smaller newspapers are worth more in relative terms than large papers. &quot;A newspaper in small– to medium– market tends to be worth more on a relative basis than a big–city paper,&quot; notes longtime newspaper analyst John Morton. &quot;Big cities tend to have more media outlets competing for advertising, and big–city newspapers are more likely to have onerous union contracts.&quot; [http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=128]&lt;/ref&gt; What emerges may be 'newspapers' unrecognizable to older readers, but which may be more timely, more topical and more flexible.

&quot;Journalistic outlets will discover,&quot; wrote Michael Hirschorn in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', &quot;that the Web allows (okay, forces) them to concentrate on developing expertise in a narrower set of issues and interests, while helping journalists from other places and publications find new audiences.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirschorn&quot; /&gt; The 'newspaper' of the future, say Hirschorn and others, may resemble ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' more than anything flung at today's stoops and driveways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minnpost.com/|title=Minnpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/23/business/media/23global.html?hp|title=A Web Site's For-Profit Approach to World News|last=Jensen|first=Elizabeth|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of that experimentation may happen in the world's fastest-growing newspaper markets. &quot;The number of newspapers and their circulation has declined the world over except in India and China,&quot; according to former [[CEO]] Olivier Fleurot of ''[[The Financial Times]]''. &quot;The world is becoming more digital but technology has helped newspapers as much as the Internet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1061803.cms|title='Newspapers have bright future'|publisher=The Times of India|date=March 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making those technological changes work for them, instead of against them, will decide whether newspapers remain vital&amp;nbsp;– or [[roadkill]] on the [[information superhighway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/kamiya/2009/02/17/newspapers/|title=The Death of the News|last=Kamiya|first=Gary|publisher=Salon|date=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalism schools in the U.S.===
The US journalism schools are also pressured to adapt to the changing landscape. At the [[Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication]], part of [[Arizona State University]], a course on &quot;The Business of Journalism&quot; was retitled &quot;The Business and Future of Journalism&quot; &lt;ref name=NYT0419&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/education/edlife/journ-t.html |title=J-Schools Play Catchup |last=Stelter |first=Brian |publisher=The New York Times |date=April 19, 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introductory level courses at the [[Medill School of Journalism]] at [[Northwestern University]] include &quot;Multimedia Storytelling&quot; and &quot;Introduction to 21st-Century Media.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT0419 /&gt; As print journalism wanes, journalism schools are focusing on the [[internet]] as a distribution medium, and are recalibrating courses to hone skills needed for jobs in the 21st century. Schools now include classes on computer programming as well as entrepreneurship. Rich Beckman, a professor at the [[University of Miami]], said &quot;There were deans all over the country saying, 'We're never going to teach computer programming in J-school.' Well, now they are.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT0419 /&gt; Centers for teaching new media innovation are being created at [[Columbia University]] and the [[City University of New York]].&lt;ref name=NYT0419 /&gt;

Although newspapers are struggling, and journalism jobs being eliminated, applications at the nation's journalism schools are increasing. The [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Columbia Journalism School]] reports a 44% jump from 2008, and the [[University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication|Annenberg School for Communication]] reports a 20% increase. Other schools report similar increases.&lt;ref name=LATIMES0417&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-onthemedia17-2009apr17,0,7925317.column |title=As newspapers decline, journalism schools thrive |publisher=[[LA Times]] |date=April 17, 2009 |first=James |last=Rainey |accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2620">[[Image:Lühhike öppetus.jpeg|right|The title page. Due to wear and tear, some underlying pages are seen in upper right corner.]]

'''''Lühhike öppetus''''' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]] for ''Brief Instruction''), by modern orthography 'Lühike õpetus', was the first [[periodical publication]] in the [[Estonian language]].  Edited by Dr. [[Peter Ernst Wilde]] and printed for a short while in 1766–1767, it described various simple medical techniques intended to be usable in the field by peasants.

The full title of the newspaper was ''Lühhike öppetus mis sees moned head rohhud täeda antakse, ni hästi innimeste kui ka veiste haigusse ning viggaduste vasto'', and it can be translated as ''Brief instruction announcing some good medicine, both for human and bovine ailments and traumas''.  It was printed weekly, with each issue having four pages.  A total of 41 issues were printed.

[[August Wilhelm Hupel]] was responsible for translating the content to [[Estonian language]].

== Classification ==
''Lühhike öppetus'' did not deal with [[news]]; thus, it is not universally classified as a [[newspaper]] — despite its format.  Various sources refer to it as a [[magazine]], a journal, or even a [[book]] published in 41 volumes.  The first regular [[Estonian language]] publication unequivocally considered a newspaper, the ''[[Tarto maa rahva Näddali-Leht]]'', appeared in 1807.

Literally, the right to publish a work. 
In the music industry, &quot;publishing&quot; is used as a catch-all shorthand for the administration of matters relating to the songwriter's and composer's share of income from a musical composition or recorded work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3500">The '''UK Young Publishing Entrepreneur (UKYPE) Award''' celebrates entrepreneurial ability within [[publishing]], and strengthens creative leadership, networking, and capacity building in the UK publishing industry.  It also focuses on strengthening the engagement between the UK and publishing in emerging markets, and seeks to further stimulate the development of the UK publishing industry in an international business context.

The award is one of a number of Creative Entrepreneur Awards run by the British Council as part of their Creative Entrepreneurship programme, both for entrepreneurs in the UK and internationally. Also included is the [[International Young Music Entrepreneur of the Year]] and [[International Young Publisher of the Year]].

The aim is to find the most talented young entrepreneurs working in the UK’s publishing industry and give them the chance to find out more about what is happening out there, by becoming part of the [[British Council|British Council’s]] international network of young creative entrepreneurs.

The UKYPE is a British Council award, co-sponsored by [[London Book Fair|The London Book Fair]], and supported by the [[The Publishers Association|Publishers’ Association]] and BookBrunch.

==UKYPE 2010==
Six finalists took part in a 10-day study tour of [[South Africa]]’s publishing industry. The group visited Cape Town and Johannesburg in early March 2010, meeting with senior figures and fellow young entrepreneurs from the [[creative industries]], and learning, first-hand, how the South African booktrade works. Upon their return to London, the finalists were interviewed again by a judging panel and assessed on their experience, understanding, and ability to spot opportunities in the South African publishing sector..,&lt;ref name=&quot;BookBrunch&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bookbrunch.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5225:first-among-equals-social-entrepreneur-wins-ukype-award&amp;catid=903:publishing&amp;Itemid=79|title=First among equals|last=Thomson|first=Liz|date=April 21, 2010 |work=[[BookBrunch]]|accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Beaumont and Fletcher folios''' were two large [[book size|folio]] collections of the stage plays of [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and his collaborators. The first was issued in 1647, and the second in 1679. The two collections were important in preserving many works of [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance drama]].

==The first folio, 1647==
The 1647 folio was published by the booksellers [[Humphrey Moseley]] and [[Humphrey Robinson]]. It was modelled on the precedents of the first two folio collections of [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Shakespeare's plays]], published in 1623 and 1632, and the first two folios of the [[Ben Jonson folios|works of Ben Jonson]] of 1616 and 1640–1. The title of the book was given as ''Comedies and Tragedies Written by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher Gentlemen,'' though the prefatory matter in the folio recognised that [[Philip Massinger]], rather than [[Francis Beaumont]], collaborated with Fletcher on some of the plays included in the volume. (In fact, the 1647 volume &quot;contained almost nothing of Beaumont's&quot; work.)&lt;ref&gt;Lee Bliss, in Kinney, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen works in Fletcher's canon that had already been published prior to 1647, and the rights to these plays belonged to the stationers who had issued those volumes; Robinson and Moseley therefore concentrated on the previously unpublished plays in the Fletcher canon.

Most of these plays had been acted onstage by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], the troupe of actors for whom Fletcher had functioned as house dramatist for most of his career. The folio featured a dedication to [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke]], signed by ten of the King's Men – [[John Lowin]], [[Joseph Taylor (17th-century actor)|Joseph Taylor]], [[Richard Robinson (17th-century actor)|Richard Robinson]], [[Robert Benfield]], [[Eliard Swanston]], Thomas Pollard, Hugh Clark, William Allen, [[Stephen Hammerton]], and [[Theophilus Bird]] – all idled by the closing of the theatres in 1642. It also contained two addresses to the reader, by [[James Shirley]] and by Moseley, and 37 [[commendatory poem]]s, long and short, by figures famous and obscure, including Shirley, [[Ben Jonson]],&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, a decade dead by 1647, was posthumously represented with an excerpt from his poem to Beaumont.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Lovelace]], [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[Richard Brome]], [[Jasper Mayne]], [[Thomas Stanley (author)|Thomas Stanley]], and Sir [[Aston Cockayne]].

The 1647 folio contains 35 works – 34 plays and 1 [[masque]]:

The 1647 folio has attracted significant attention from scholars and bibliographers, and various specialised studies of the folio (books on the book) have been written.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 83–5.&lt;/ref&gt; As with Shakespeare's [[First Folio]], the typesetting of individual compositors and the work of individual printers has been traced and analysed – including that of Susan Islip, one of the rare instances of a female printer in the 17th century.

==The second folio, 1679==
The second folio, titled ''Fifty Comedies and Tragedies,'' was published by the booksellers [[Henry Herringman]],&lt;ref&gt;Herringman was a member of the syndicates of stationers who issued the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Fourth Folio]] of Shakespeare's plays in 1685, and the [[Ben Jonson folios|third Ben Jonson folio]] in 1692.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Martyn (publisher)|John Martyn]], and [[John and Richard Marriot|Richard Marriot]]; the printing was done by J. Macock. The three stationers had obtained the rights to previously-published works,&lt;ref&gt;The 17 printed before 1647, and ''[[The Wild Goose Chase]],'' which had been published in 1652.&lt;/ref&gt; and added 18 dramas to the 35 of the first folio —

* ''[[A King and No King]]''

* ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]''
* ''[[Thierry and Theodoret]]''
* ''[[The Woman Hater]]''
{{col-end}}

— for a total of 53. The second folio added features that the first lacked. Many songs in the plays were given in full. Cast lists were prefixed to 25 of the dramas, lists that provide the names of the leading actors in the original productions of the plays. These lists can be informative on the companies involved and the dates of first productions; the cast list prefixed to ''[[The Honest Man's Fortune]],'' for example, reveals that the play was originally staged by the [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] in the 1612–13 period.

On the negative side, the texts in the second folio were set into type from the previously-printed quarto texts, and never from manuscript; the texts of the plays in the first collection were printed from manuscript sources.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
Taken together, the folios contain two works that are generally thought to be the work of Beaumont alone – ''The Knight of the Burning Pestle'' and ''The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn'' – and fifteen that are solo efforts by Fletcher, and perhaps a dozen that are actual Beaumont/Fletcher collaborations. The rest are Fletcher's collaborations with Massinger and other writers.&lt;ref&gt;See under [[Francis Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither folio is perfect in its inclusions; the first contains ''The Laws of Candy,'' which is in all likelihood a play by [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]], and the second has ''The Coronation,'' a play by [[James Shirley]]. Two Fletcher/Massinger collaborations were left out of both collections: ''[[A Very Woman]]'' was printed in a volume of Massinger's plays in 1655, while ''[[Sir John van Olden Barnavelt]]'' remained in manuscript until the 19th century.

==Later editions==
The folios limited but did not extinguish the market for individual editions of the plays; such editions were printed when the chances for profit seemed favourable. Humphrey Robinson and Alice Moseley (Humphrey Moseley's widow) issued a quarto of ''Beggar's Bush'' in 1661, for example. During the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era and into the 18th century, the plays in the Beaumont/Fletcher canon were very popular – though they were often performed in adapted versions rather than in the originals; and the adaptations then appeared in print. An adaptation of ''The Island Princess'' was published in 1669; and adapted version of ''Monsieur Thomas'' was printed in 1678.  ''Beggar's Bush'' became ''The Royal Merchant,'' published in 1706 – and later, ''The Merchant of Bruges.''&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend in favour of new adaptations over original versions made it easier for Herringman, Martyn, and Mariot to obtain permissions to reprint those originals in their 1679 collection.

'''Fine press''' [[printing]] and [[publishing]] comprises historical and contemporary printers and publishers publishing [[book]]s and other printed matter of exceptional intrinsic quality and artistic taste, including both commercial and [[private press]]es.  Their dedication to fine printing distinguishes them from other [[small press]]es.  Fine press publications are often published in [[limited edition]]s, that are swiftly bought up by [[Book collecting|book collectors]] and libraries.

==History of fine press==

As part of the [[Art Nouveau]] movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Englishman [[William Morris]] wanted to harken back to a golden age of printing, printmaking, and publishing.  One of the books they published was the [[Kelmscott Chaucer]].  Soon, fine presses began to spring up in the United States as well.  The most prominent was the [[Roycroft Press]].  Los Angeles was a center of the fine press movement, particularly centered on the Ward Ritchie press

[[File:Festhalle-ffm004.jpg|thumb|Frontside]]
The '''Frankfurt Book Fair''' (FBF) ({{lang-de|Frankfurter Buchmesse}}) is the world's largest [[trade fair]] for [[books]], based on the number of publishing companies represented, as well as the number of visitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Series Book Tells about the Heaven and the New Jerusalem|periodical=Christian Telegraph|date=24 October 2013|accessdate=24 October 2013|url=http://www.christiantelegraph.com/issue21446.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is held annually in mid-October at the [[Frankfurt Trade Fair]] grounds in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]]. The first three days are restricted exclusively to trade visitors; the general public can attend on the last two.

Representatives from book publishing and multimedia companies from all over the world come to the Frankfurt Book Fair in order to negotiate international [[publishing]] rights and licensing fees. The fair is organised by a subsidiary company of the ''German Publishers and Booksellers Association''. For five days more than 7,000 exhibitors from over 100 countries and more than 286,000 visitors take part. The Frankfurt Book Fair is considered to be the most important book fair in the world for international deals and trading.

==History==
===Origins===
[[File:Buchmesse I..JPG|thumb|upright|The Frankfurt Book Fair with the fair's tower ([[Messeturm]], 2004)]]
The Frankfurt Book Fair has a tradition that spans over more than 500 years. Soon after [[Johannes Gutenberg]] had developed [[printing]] in movable letters in [[Mainz]] near Frankfurt, the first book fair was held by local [[bookselling|booksellers]]. Until the end of the 17th century, it was the most important book fair in Europe. As a consequence of political and cultural developments, it was eclipsed by the [[Leipzig Book Fair]] during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. After World War II, the first book fair was held again in 1949 at the [[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt|St. Paul's Church]]. Since then, it has regained its pre-eminent position.

===Significance===
The Frankfurt Book Fair is a critical marketing event for the launching of books, but it is also an important event to facilitate the negotiation of the international sale of rights and licences. Visitors take the opportunity to obtain information about the publishing market, to network, and to do business. Publishers, [[Literary agent|agents]], booksellers, [[librarians]], [[academics]], [[illustrators]], service providers, [[film producer]]s, [[translators]], [[printer (publisher)|printers]], [[professional body|professional]] and [[industry trade group|trade associations]], [[institutions]], [[artists]], authors, antiquarians, [[software]] and [[multimedia]] suppliers all take part in the events and business climate of Frankfurt Book Fair. In 2006, more than 11,000 [[journalists]] from 66 countries reported on the fair which brought together 7,272 individual exhibitors from 113 countries, and more than 183,000 trade visitors. In 2009, there were 7,314 individual exhibitors from some 100 countries, presenting over 400,000 books. Some 300,000 visitors attended the fair. 

During the fair the [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]] is given, during a ceremony in the [[Frankfurter Paulskirche|Paulskirche]]. The prize has been awarded each year since 1950.

The fair is also the birthplace of the [[Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year]], a humorous award which is given to the book with the oddest title.

===Parallel events and joint ventures===
The Frankfurt Book Fair is at the origin of other initiatives which would not exist without it, and which are very closely linked to its goals and, up to a point, management structure. 

On the occasion of the 1980 Fair, was founded [http://www.litprom.de/about_us.html Litprom] - the Society for the Promotion of African, Asian and Latin American Literature. As a non profit association, it monitors literary trends and developments and selects the best examples of creative writing from Africa, Asia and Latin America for translation into German, and to promote them in Germany, Switzerland and Austria by encouraging contacts between authors and publishers from the &quot;Third World&quot; and those in the German-speaking region; it serves as an information centre and clearing house about literature from Africa, Asia and Latin America; it helps establish and encourage a forum of debate about &quot;Third World&quot; literature. 

Since June 2006, a [[joint venture]] has been added: the annual [[Cape Town Bookfair]]. The [[Abu Dhabi International Book Fair]] is another joint venture now.

In 2006, [[Litcam]], a campaign first of all against [[illiteracy]] began. In this context, the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2007 also started a [[short story]] project named &quot;Who's on the line? Call for free&quot; by and for people with [[human migration|migration]] background.

==Guests of honour, focuses of interests==
[[File:Frankfurt Book Fair 2008.jpg|thumb| Turkey's Guest of Honour pavilion in 2008]]
Since 1976, a ''guest of honour'', or a focus of interest is named for the fair. A special literary programme is organised for the occasion (readings, arts exhibitions, public discussion panels, theatre productions, and radio and TV programmes). A special exhibition hall is set up for the guest country, and the major publishing houses are present at the fair.

Some choices aroused criticism and controversy. The 2007 fair attracted criticism from both the Spanish and German media. German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' described it as &quot;closed-minded&quot; for its policy of not including the many Catalans who write in Spanish in its definition of Catalan literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,510291,00.html A Controversial Homage to Catalonia: Commerce Replaces Politics at the Frankfurt Book Fair – International – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to exclude any element of &quot;Spanishness&quot;, defined as literature exclusively done in Spanish, from the fair was made in spite of the fact that the Spanish government contributed more than 6 million euros towards the cost of the fair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mityc.es/es-ES/Servicios/GabinetePrensa/NotasPrensa/HistoricoNoticias/2006/7/FirmaConvenioIndustriaEditorialFrankfurt2007.03.07.06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guest of Honour in 2009 was China, stirring a controversy about the country's record on human rights.

The art of '''book rebinding''' involves a used or treasured [[book]] and rebinding it to protect it, or continue the life of the book. Popular rebinding materials include [[leather]]. The process usually includes reinforcement of the book signatures and then a recovering process begins. The most popular books to be rebound is the [[Bible]].

The Alderbrink Press maintained the traditions of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Mary Camp, ''Ralph Fletcher Seymour and his Alderbrink Press (Chicago, 1898&amp;ndash;1965): A History and Checklist of His Publications'' (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan O.

The '''Queen Anne Press''' is a small private press. It was created in 1951 by [[Lord Kemsley]], proprietor of the [[Sunday Times]], to publish the works of contemporary authors. In 1952, as a wedding present to his then Foreign Editor, Kemsley made [[Ian Fleming]] its managing director.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Pearson, John. ''The Life of Ian Fleming'', p.188. McGraw-Hill, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;  The press concentrated on producing finely printed and bound editions, often with small limitations. Lycett states that under Fleming's management, the company was modelled on the [[Black Sun Press]],&lt;ref&gt;Lycett, Andrew. ''Ian Fleming'', p.43. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; run by the poet [[Harry Crosby]], nephew of financier [[J. P. Morgan]]. Director Ann Fleming, the socialite wife of Ian Fleming (and a long-time correspondent of [[Evelyn Waugh]]&lt;ref&gt;Amory, Mark. ''The Letters of Ann Fleming'', p.143-4. London: Collins Harvill, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;), requested support for the press from her literary friends, which included [[Noël Coward]], [[Nancy Mitford]] and [[Stephen Spender]]. She asked Waugh in particular &quot;please write me ten thousand words on some saint with interesting habits&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Amory, Mark. ''The Letters of Ann Fleming'', p.147. London: Collins Harvill, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Waugh proposed to collect a few robust reviews under the title ''Offensive Matter''.&lt;ref&gt;Lycett, Andrew. ''Ian Fleming'', p.227-8. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This was shelved, however, in favour of an illustrated book ''The Holy Places'', which had previously only been published in periodical form. The book, with engravings by [[Reynolds Stone]] (a protégé of [[John Betjeman]], according to Waugh),&lt;ref&gt;Amory, Mark. ''The Letters of Evelyn Waugh'', p.391. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; was ready in time for Christmas, 1952. In the early years, the press also published works by other highly respected authors including travel writer [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]] and the essayist [[Cyril Connolly]], whose book ''The Missing Diplomats'', a scoop on the Cambridge Spy Ring,&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond Bond'', p.9-10, published by Eton College Library, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; was a popular work, prompting Ann to write &quot;business is flourishing&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to Evelyn Waugh. ''The Letters of Ann Fleming'', p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; A possible purchase of the press by Ian and Ann Fleming was considered in 1954-5, but although a price was discussed it appears the sale never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;Amory, Mark. ''The Letters of Ann Fleming'', p.112. London: Collins Harvill, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Fleming remained at the helm until his death in 1964, and the press was subsequently absorbed by the publishing empire of [[Robert Maxwell]], becoming an imprint specialising in sporting books. In 2007 the Queen Anne Press was acquired by Ian Fleming's literary estate.

A '''back-of-the-book index''' (or just '''book index''') is a collection of entries, often [[alphabetical]]ly arranged in an [[index (publishing)|index]], made to allow users to locate information in a given [[book]] (or related document). 

Perhaps the most advanced investigation of problems related to book indexes is made in the development of [[topic maps]], which started as a way of representing the knowledge structures inherent in traditional back-of-the-book indexes.

Texts about the indexing of specialized books include: History (Towery, 1998), law books (Kendrick &amp; Zafran, 2001), medicine (Wyman, 1999), psychology (Hornyak, 2002), among others.

==Indexing software==
Commercial software packets are available for aiding an indexer in building a book index.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asindexing.org/reference-shelf/software/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book indexing as a profession==
In the United States, according to tradition, the index for a non-fiction book is the responsibility of the author, but most authors don't actually do it. Most indexing is done by freelancers hired by authors, publishers or an independent business which manages the production of a book.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asindexing.org/about-indexing/what-is-indexing/#FAQ1004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Society for Indexing ===
The American Society for Indexing, Inc. (ASI) is a national association founded in 1968 to promote excellence in indexing and increase awareness of the value of well-designed indexes. ASI serves indexers, librarians, abstractors, editors, publishers, database producers, data searchers, product developers, technical writers, academic professionals, researchers and readers, and others concerned with indexing. It is the only professional organization in the United States devoted solely to the advancement of indexing, abstracting and related methods of information retrieval.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="990">'''''Scientia est lux lucis''''' is [[Latin]] for &quot;knowledge is enlightenment&quot; (literally &quot;knowledge is the light of light&quot;), also rendered as &quot;scientific knowledge is enlightenment.&quot; This is believed to have been said by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (April 15, 1452 – May 2, 1519), the archetypal [[Polymath|Renaissance man]]. 

The phrase is the motto of the [[Vermont State Colleges]], a consortium of public colleges in the U.S. state of [[Vermont]].

The phrase is also the official motto of UK-based publishing house, Palladian Publications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7451">A '''copyright transfer agreement''' is a legal document containing provisions for the conveyance of full or partial [[copyright]] from the rights owner to another party. It is similar to [[contract]]s signed between [[author]]s and [[publisher]]s but does not normally involve the payment of remuneration or [[royalties]].&lt;ref name=Gadd2003-4&gt;{{cite doi|10.1087/095315103322422053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such agreements are a key element of [[Subscription business model|subscription]]-based [[academic publishing]],&lt;ref name=Friedman1982&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1021/ci00034a001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been said to facilitate the handling of copyright-based permissions in print-only publishing.&lt;ref name=Lagowski1982&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1021/ci00034a600}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the age of electronic communication, the benefits of copyright transfer agreements have been questioned,&lt;ref name=Bachrach1998&gt;{{cite doi|10.1126/science.281.5382.1459}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while they remain the norm, open [[license]]s as used in [[open access]] publishing have been established as an alternative.&lt;ref name=Carroll2011&gt;{{cite doi|10.1371/journal.pbio.1001210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Copyright transfer agreements became common in the publishing business after the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] in the United States and similar legislation in other countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1107/S0021889878012753}}&lt;/ref&gt; redefined copyright as accruing to the author from the moment of creation (rather than publication) of a work.&lt;ref name=Bachrach1998/&gt; This required publishers to acquire copyrights from the creator in order to sell the works or access to it, and written statements signed by the rights owner became necessary in order for the copyright transfer to be considered valid.&lt;ref name=Friedman1982/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#204 Section 204] of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
{{Quotation|The situation where authors hold the copyright usually involves considerable effort in the form of correspondence and record keeping and often leads to unnecessary delays. Although this may appear to be trivial for a few requests, a good scholarly journal publishing exciting papers can expect several hundred requests per year; a task of this magnitude can become onerous. On the other hand, if the Journal holds the copyright, requests, value judgements, and permissions can be handled expeditiously to the satisfaction of all concerned.|J. Lagowski (1982)&lt;ref name=Lagowski1982/&gt;}}

Granting publishers the permission to copy, display and distribute the work is necessary for publishers to act as such, and copyright transfer agreements across a wide range of publishers have such provisions.&lt;ref name=Gadd2003-4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1553-2712.1999.tb00393.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reach of copyright transfer agreements can go well beyond that, and &quot;[s]ome publishers require that, to the extent possible, copyright be transferred to them.&quot;&lt;ref name=Friedman1982/&gt; This means that no one, including the authors, can reuse text, tables, or figures in other publications without first getting permission from the new copyright owner.&lt;ref name=&quot;understand&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.2214/AJR.09.2655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright transfer agreements also ask that the authors confirm to actually own the copyright for all the materials pertaining to a given act of publishing, and that the item for which the copyright is to be transferred has not been previously published and is not under consideration to be published elsewhere,&lt;ref name=&quot;understand&quot;/&gt; to limit the frequency of [[duplicate publication]] and [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref name=Gadd2003-4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1088/1748-6041/7/1/010201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Critics have said that the copyright transfer agreement in commercial scholarly publishing is &quot;as much about ensuring long–term asset management as it is about providing service to the academic community&quot; because the practice seems to grant favor to the publisher in a way that does not obviously benefit the content creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willinsky|first=John|title=Copyright Contradictions in Scholarly Publishing|journal=[[First Monday (journal)]]|date=4 November 2002|volume=7|issue=11|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1006/927|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright transfer agreements often conflict with [[self-archiving]] practices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1108/00220410310698239}}&lt;/ref&gt; or appear to do so due to ambiguous language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1002/asi.20494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other models ==
Copyright transfer agreements are one way to govern permissions based on copyright. Since the advent of digital publishing, various commentators have pointed out the benefits of author-retained copyright,&lt;ref name=Bachrach1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilbanks2006&gt;{{cite doi|10.1136/sbmj.39063.730660.F7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishers have started to implement it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1242/jcs.00873}}&lt;/ref&gt; using license agreements, wherein the author of the work retains copyright and gives the publisher the permission (exclusive or not) to reproduce and distribute the work. A third model is the so-called &quot;browse-wrap&quot; or &quot;click-wrap&quot; license model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burk|first=Dan L.|title=Intellectual Property in the Context of e-Science |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2007|volume=12|issue=2|url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol12/issue2/burk.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is becoming more and more popular in the form of the [[Creative Commons]] licenses: it allows anyone (including the publisher) to reproduce and distribute the work, with some possible restrictions. Creative Commons licenses are used by many [[open access journal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1371/journal.pbio.1001195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author addenda ==
Copyright transfer agreements are usually prepared by the publisher, and some print journals include a copy of the statement in every issue they published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/BF00348410}}&lt;/ref&gt; If authors wish to deviate from the default phrasing&amp;nbsp;– ''e.g.'', if they want to retain copyright or would not like to grant the publisher an exclusive right to publish&amp;nbsp;– they can specify desired modifications, either by editing the document directly or by attaching an [[addendum#In contracts|addendum]] to a copy of the default version. Publisher policies on the acceptance of such addenda vary, though. Some institutions offer instructions and assistance for staff in creating such addenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author rights: using the SPARC Author Addendum to secure your rights as the author of a journal article|url=http://www.sparc.arl.org/resources/authors/addendum|work=SPARC|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amend a Publishing Agreement|url=https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/authors/amend|work=Harvard University Library|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Copyright Licensing Agency''' (CLA) is a UK [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organisation]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infogov.salford.ac.uk/copyright/clalicence.php&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1983 by the [[Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society|Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society]] (ALCS) and the [[Publishers Licensing Society|Publishers' Licensing Society]] (PLS) to perform collective licensing on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cla.co.uk/about/governance/cla_history&lt;/ref&gt; The Copyright Licensing Agency is based in Saffron House in Farringdon, London with additional offices in Edinburgh, Scotland.

== Aim ==

The aim of the CLA is to obtain fair rewards for authors, visual artists and publishers for the copying of their work. CLA is a non-profit organisation and money collected in licence fees is distributed to the copyright owners after company costs have been deducted. In the financial year 2009/2010 CLA distributed £51.4m to authors, visual artists and publishers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cla.co.uk/protect_creativity/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International ===

As well as UK publications, CLA have agreements with [[reproduction rights organisation]]s (RROs) that allow employees to copy works published in 30 other countries. CLA also work with the [[International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisations]] (IFRRO) towards the development of international codes of conduct.

=== The Hargreaves Report (2011) ===

In March 2011, CLA released a report by [[Price Waterhouse Coopers]] into the economic impact of copyright in the UK. The report showed that £4.3 billion is estimated to have been invested in new content in the UK in 2007, of which £1.6 billion was invested in art and literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cla.co.uk/data/corporate_material/submissions/2011_pwc_final_report.pdf 'An economic analysis of copyright, secondary copyright and collective licensing']. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The report was used to inform an independent review into intellectual property and growth, with particular reference to the digital economy. This review was commissioned by the government and led by [[Ian Hargreaves|Professor Ian Hargreaves]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lisa [http://www.thebookseller.com/news/changing-copyright-laws-could-stifle-literature-report-finds.html &quot;Changing copyright laws could &quot;stifle&quot; literature, report finds&quot;] The Bookseller, 11.03.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright Law ==

== Compliance ==

CLA established its compliance arm, Copywatch in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copywatch.org/ Copywatch]&lt;/ref&gt; Copywatch was established in 1996 by The Copyright Licensing Agency to counter illegal copying of books, magazines and journals in the business and local authority areas.  The company is also a member of the Alliance Against IP Theft and the [[Trading Standards Institute]].

http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/copy/c-manage/c-ownerorg/c-ownerorg-print.htm

== What can I do with this content? ==

At Frankfurt Book Fair in October 2011, CLA launched a new industry-standard [[digital copyright icon]]&lt;ref&gt;http://whatcanidowiththiscontent.com/&lt;/ref&gt; which displays publishers' key terms of use on their websites. Entitled, 'What can I do with this content?', the tool aims to benefit publishers by communicating their copyright policy; providing an industry-standard format for displaying copyright terms on the internet and generating revenue for those publishers signed up to the UK collective licensing scheme.&lt;ref&gt;'Why Protecting Your Content is Key to Your Digital Future' Publishing Perspectives, Frankfurt Show Daily (Wednesday 12 October)http://publishingperspectives.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Frankfurt-Show-Daily-Wed-12-Oct-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4312">'''Clandestine literature''', also called &quot;underground literature&quot;, refers to a type of editorial and publishing process that involves self-publishing works, often in contradiction with the legal standards of a location. Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship, prosecution, or other suppression. In academic study, such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications (as opposed to officially sanctioned, orthodox publishing).

Examples of clandestine literature include the [[Samizdat]] literature of Soviet dissidents; the [[Aljamiado]] literature of [[Al-Andalus]] Spain;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baralt|first=Luce López|title=Islam in Spanish Literature: From the Middle Ages to the Present|year=1992|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004094604|pages=171-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[nushu]] writing of some upper-class women in [[Hunan]], China, from around the 10th century to the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Xing Lu, Wenshan Jia, D. Ray Heisey|title=Chinese Communication Studies: Contexts and Comparisons|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9781567506563|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clandestine publications were plentiful during the [[French Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era in 18th-century France, circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clandestine E-Texts from the Eighteenth Century|url=http://www.vc.unipmn.it/~mori/e-texts/|publisher=University of Turin-Vercelli|accessdate=October 20, 2012|author=Gianluca Mori}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the [[Ancien Régime]], or even straight out atheist. These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s, and contained such controversial works as ''[[Treatise of the Three Impostors]]'' and the reverend [[Jean Meslier]]s ''Atheistic Testament''.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan I. Israel, Enlightenment Contested'', Oxford University Press, 2006, pp. 722ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Both texts were later published in edited versions by [[Voltaire]], but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe. The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France. These books were usually termed &quot;philosophical works&quot;, but varied greatly in content from pornography, utopian novels, political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like [[Baron d'Holbach]], [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Darnton, The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France, W.W. Norton &amp; Company, New York, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons, when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power, but also for reasons at a formal level, when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works. Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs, often being funded by the authors themselves.

Works that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature, such as ''[[Das Kapital]]'' and ''[[El Buscón]]''. 

A legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad. The [[Olympia Press]] in Paris published several 20th-century English-language writers, including [[Henry Miller]], who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time.

'''ConsumerLab.com, LLC.''' is a privately held American company registered in [[White Plains, NY]]. It is a publisher of test results on health, wellness, and nutrition products.&lt;ref name=&quot;highbeam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/sports/playmagazine/04play-supplement.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Give Us This Day Our Daily Supplements] ''New York Times'', 4 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is &quot;to identify the best quality health and nutrition products through independent testing.&quot;&lt;ref name=aboutCL /&gt; 

ConsumerLab.com was founded in 1999. It purchases supplement products on the open market for testing and publishes a report on them with reports obtained on sample products it submits to third party laboratories for testing. It primarily derives revenue from the sale of subscriptions to its online publications. Other sources of revenue include a proprietary certification program, licensing fees, contents re-publication license fees and advertising.&lt;ref name=aboutCL&gt;{{cite web|title=About ConsumerLab.com|url=http://www.consumerlab.com/aboutcl.asp|publisher=Consumerlab.com|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
ConsumerLab.com was founded by Tod Cooperman, MD in 1999.

==Personnel==
In March 2006, ConsumerLab.com founder and president, Dr. Tod Cooperman, appeared in a hearing before the House of Representatives' [[Committee on Government Reform]] on the Regulation of Dietary Supplements.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/house/pdf/109hrg/27187.pdf  |title=The Regulation of Dietary Supplements: A Review of Consumer Safeguards |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|format=PDF |page=184 |date=9 March 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, he issued a panel statement on &quot;Dietary Supplements: What Seniors Need To Know&quot;  hearing at the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aging.senate.gov/hearing_detail.cfm?id=325265&amp; hearing detail]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SCPR&gt;{{cite web|title=Kohl Calls For Better Labeling, Reduction of Contaminents in Dietary Supplements|url=http://aging.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=325285&amp;&amp;|publisher=United States Senate Special Committee On Aging|accessdate=11 December 2012|date=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aging.senate.gov/events/hr221tc.pdf |title=Testimony of Tod Cooperman, MD, President, ConsumerLab.com to Senate Special Committee on Aging - Subcommittee on Dietary Supplements |publisher=Tod Cooperman |format=PDF| date=26 May 2010 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- He was one of the four members of the second panel, though it didn't specifically identify his statements as expert testimony --&gt; William Obermeyer, Ph.D., helped found ConsumerLab.com and served as V.P. for Research until 2012.&lt;!-- sources say Obermeyer and Cooperman founded it together, did he just help or did they found together? we need indepedent sources. --&gt; Dr. Obermeyer worked as a Natural Products Chemist testing dietary supplements within the [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research|CDER]] at the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]  for nine years prior to joining ConsumerLab.com in 1999. Dr. Obermeyer now serves as an advisor to ConsumerLab.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abstracts.aapspharmaceutica.com/ExpoAAPS07/CC/forms/attendee/index.aspx?content=speakerInfo&amp;speakerId=6576 William Obermeyer] 2007 Annual Meeting &amp; Exposition, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.&lt;/ref&gt; The current V.P. for research is Mark L.

==Products and services==
ConsumerLab.com reports that its main revenue comes from sales of online subscriptions. Other revenue-generating products include books and survey reports&lt;ref&gt;Anetor, John I (2005) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2568756/ ConsumerLab.com's &quot;Guide to Buying Vitamins &amp; Supplements: What's Really in the Bottle?&quot;] ''Journal of the National Medical Association'', '''97''' (2): 304–305.&lt;/ref&gt; and the sale of licenses to publish its proprietary information.&lt;ref name=aboutCL /&gt; Tests are not conducted by ConsumerLab.com but are contracted out to independent laboratories.

Products are not accepted from manufacturers, and are retested every few years.&lt;ref name=JML /&gt; A JMLA review noted that of the reports it reviewed, about half of them were dated.&lt;ref name=JML /&gt; For a fee, ConsumerLab.com offers a voluntary certification program. Products that pass the certification can use the &quot;CL Seal of Approval&quot; for which there is a licensing fee.&lt;ref name=aboutCL /&gt;&lt;ref name=JML /&gt; Vendors of brand name products named in its reports can, for an advertising fee, be listed in a &quot;Where to Buy&quot; section which is clearly marked as advertising.&lt;ref name=JML /&gt;

==Controversies==
In January 2005 the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which describes itself as a &quot;trade association representing dietary supplement manufacturers and ingredient suppliers&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crnusa.org/who_about.html About CRN] ''Council for Responsible Nutrition'' website. Retrieved 12 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; registered a complaint against ConsumerLab.com with the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. It alleged that the &quot;entire business model&quot; of ConsumerLab.com &quot;represents an egregious form of consumer fraud and deception&quot;. CRN requested the FTC to impose actions against ConsumerLab, requiring them to disclose all test results as well as the identities of the labs that perform its tests, and change its company name to avoid implying that it does its own testing.&lt;ref name=&quot;NW&quot;&gt;[http://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2005-02-25/crn-asks-ftc-to-investigate-consumerlab-com/ Nutraceuticals World]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005, FTC deferred the case, noting that it was not taking any actions at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/closings/staff/050315crnreconsumerlab.pdf FTC]&lt;/ref&gt; ConsumerLab.com filed a suit against CRN alleging eight causes of action that CRN's publication of its complaint letter to FTC was defamation, infliction of intentional harm and six other causes. In May 2006, the New York Supreme Court dismissed this suit for failure to state a claim for all but the defamation allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Action No. 06-1590 (RMC)|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_06-cv-01590/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_06-cv-01590-0.pdf|publisher=US Government Printing Office|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural Foods Merchandiser reports that the dispute was eventually settled and dismissed.&lt;ref name=&quot;NFM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Laurie|first=Budgar|title=ConsumerLab, CRN call legal truce|url=http://newhope360.com/managing-your-business/consumerlab-crn-call-legal-truce|publisher=Natural Foods Merchandiser|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary supplement testing==
In the United States, the government does not test supplements; the law leaves it up to the manufacturers to be accurate and truthful. Consumers have a hard time finding reliable information on these products and ConsumerLab.com attempts to fill these needs.&lt;ref name=JML&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glassman|first=Nancy|title=Electronic resource review: Consumerlab.com|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association|year=2004| volume=92 | issue=4 |pages=509–510|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC521528/|}}&lt;/ref&gt; ConsumerLab.com narrates its contractors' [[#External Links|testing methods]] and quality criteria/standards used to test supplements.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutCL&quot;/&gt;

=== Notable findings ===


In 2008, ConsumerLab.com submitted 12 [[red yeast rice]] product samples to a third party testing lab.&lt;!-- &quot;Our study used an independent testing organization...&quot; --&gt; Red yeast rice contains a compound called [[lovastatin]]. The study finds that 12 samples sent for testing had a per-capsule [[lovastatin]] level of: mean 2.54mg, median 2.12mg with a [[standard deviation]] of 2.60mg and a range of 0.10mg to 10.01mg. The major limitation of this study is that it does not account for batch-to-batch variation as only one batch per sample was tested.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arch&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Ram Y|coauthors=Cooperman, Tod.,Obermeyer, William.,Becker, David J.|title=Marked Variability of Monacolin Levels in Commercial Red Yeast Rice Products|journal=Arch Intern Med|year=2010|volume=170|issue=19|pages=1722–1727|url=http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=226109|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This study's most important limitation is the possibility of batch-to-batch variability of the products we tested. Our approach was to test samples from a single lot of each product. --&gt; 

In 2011, a ConsumerLab.com study found that two of three [[coconut water]] products, commonly promoted for hydration and [[electrolyte]] balance, contained less [[sodium]] and [[magnesium]] than was claimed on the label.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=Anahad|title=Really?

In 2012, a ConsumerLab.com study on [[5-hour Energy]] drink reported that the sample it sent for testing contained about 207 mg of caffeine.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web|last=Hudson|first=William|title=FDA investigates deaths preliminarily linked to energy shots|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/15/health/energy-drinks-fda-investigates/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=12 December 2012|date=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22673">This is a '''list of ISBN identifier groups''', the second element in 13-digit [[ISBN]]s (first in 10-digit ones). The identifier is assigned to either mark a [[publisher]]'s place of business or the [[language]] of the books it publishes.

The &quot;original&quot; set of identifiers, assigned prior to the introduction of the ISBN-13 and as such to 978-prefix books, ranges from one to five [[numerical digit]]s according to the following structure:
:0-5, 7
:600-649
:80-94
:950-989
:9900-9989
:99900-99999
They are assigned in approximate descending order of publishing volume. Because the smaller identifiers have room for lesser numbers of publishers and ISBNs, several countries have had more than one identifier assigned to them. On the other hand, several countries (Australia, the United States, Canada, France, Austria, Switzerland...) have no identifier because they fall in the &quot;language groups&quot;.

The structure for the identifiers of the 979- prefix and whether it will have language-specific identifiers is not well known, but two identifiers have been assigned (979-10-, to France, and 979-11, to Republic of Korea). Also, 979-0 has been reserved for the use of [[International Standard Music Number]] for [[sheet music]].

[[File:Libros de Eloísa Cartonera 2.jpg|thumb|Cartonera books from Eloísa Cartonera.]]
'''Cartonera''' is a social, political and artistic [[publishing]] movement that began in [[Argentina]] in 2003 and has since spread to countries throughout [[Latin America]] and, more recently, to [[Europe]] and [[Africa]]. The founders, [[Washington Cucurto]], Javier Barilaro, and Fernanda Laguna started [[Eloisa Cartonera]] in [[Buenos Aires]] in response to the 2001 economic crisis during which the Argentine peso plummeted to one third of its value. The tough economic conditions led to an increase in the number of cartoneros, people who make their living collecting and selling salvaged materials to recycling plants. 

Cartonera books are made from cardboard bought from cartoneros at three to five times the price set by recycling plants. The cardboard is then used to create covers for short books of prose or poetry. Each book cover is hand painted and sold on the streets at the cost of production in order to increase access to literature. This method of publication has provided the opportunity for unknown authors to be published, as well as for renowned authors to reach a more diverse audience. Beyond selling affordable books, the cartoneras promote literacy and the democratization of literature through workshops and book fairs which bring the greater public in contact with literature. The cartonera publishers also involve the community in the process of book creation and distribution through a cooperative learning experience which pushes aside educational and socioeconomic divides among participants. The books are generally published in small editions of 100 or fewer; however, popular texts are kept in print or printed through neighboring cartoneras.&lt;ref&gt;Laguna, Fernanda. &quot;No hay cuchillo sin rosas: Historia de una editorial latinoamericana&quot;. Buenos Aires: Eloisa Cartonera. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bilbija, Ksenija, and Celis Carbajal, Paloma. Akademia Cartonera: A Primer of Latin American Cartonera Publishers. Madison, WI: Parallel, University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the cartoneras publish books in print form, information about the publishing houses themselves is often available electronically through their webpages, blogs, and wikis, or through online newspaper stories, interviews, and journal articles. While digital mediums are often used to write about cartonera, the books themselves are art-objects steeped in the smells and smudges of tempera paint and rough scissor-cut edges. Some cartonera books are now being preserved, most notably through the University of Wisconsin at Madison's library collection, but the majority of the editions continue to circulate (as they are intended to do) and will disintegrate within ten years due to acid in the cardboard. As with other digitized databases and guides, the list below includes some of the presently known cartoneras, a number which is always shifting.

====[[:pt:Dulcineia Catadora|Dulcineia Catadora]]====
''Dulcinéia Catadora'' was founded in 2007 by sculptor Lúcia Rosa. From its inception, Dulcinéia distinguished itself from other cartoneras by its strong relationship with the Movimento Nacional dos Catadores de Materiais Recicláveis, which works closely with the cooperatives formed by catadores to protect their rights and shift the negative associations with their title “catador” and their job sorting trash. Rosa had established a relationship with Cooperglicério, the organization that oversees forty-five recycling cooperatives in the Glicério region of São Paulo. Dulcinéia Catadora currently holds weekly workshops in São Paulo’s trash and recycling centers where catadores help make books as part of the collaboration between Dulcinéia Catadora and the Cooperglicério recycling collective. The books are sold in the center of the city by Dulcinéia members, and involve “interventions”, where for example, the collective dresses in cardboard box outfits covered with cartonera books and recites poetry through megaphones.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cartonera Publishers - Research Guides at University of Wisconsin-Madison.&quot; Cartonera Publishers Research Guides.

La Cartonera was founded in 2008 in Cuernavaca, México by Raúl Silva, Valeria López, Dany Hurpin, Alicia Reardon, Rocato, Nayeli Sánchez, &amp; José Antonio Suárez. The logo for La Cartonera displays a man sitting in the street dedicated to reading. He is a symbol of the work of all of the Cartoneros.  La Cartonera serves as an institution that brings together writers, artists, authors, and cartoneros. Editor Raúl Silva explains in La Cartonera’s blog that, “we live within an enormous machine that never stops. The vertigo of the massive and the successful is an illness that seems to be incurable. It is important to think of and to know that at the margin of these enormous, monstrous publishing houses there exist small gestures that just want to construct castles in the air”.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cartonera Publishers - Research Guides at University of Wisconsin-Madison.&quot; Cartonera Publishers Research Guides.

After purchasing cardboard from cartoneros, a group of young people from poor neighborhoods in Lima hand manufacture, assemble, paint, and design the books. Sarita Cartonera has also developed a literacy program called Libros, Un Modelo Para Armar (LUMPA), where new readers are introduced to literary criticism and directly engage with the production of literature. LUMPA's pedagogical model is currently used by a literacy program at Harvard University that is implemented in the Boston Public Schools.

'''Publishing''' is the process of production and [[dissemination]] of [[literature]], [[music]], or [[information]] — the activity of making information available to the general public. In some cases, authors may be their own publishers, meaning: originators and developers of [[content (media and publishing)|content]] also provide [[media (communication)|media]] to deliver and display the content for the same. Also, the word publisher can refer to the individual who leads a publishing company or [[imprint]] or to a person who owns a magazine.

Traditionally, the term refers to the distribution of printed works such as books (the &quot;book trade&quot;) and [[newspaper]]s. With the advent of digital information systems and the [[Internet]], the scope of publishing has expanded to include electronic resources, such as the electronic versions of books and periodicals, as well as [[micropublishing]], [[Electronic publishing|website]]s, [[Blog software|blog]]s, [[video game publisher]]s and the like.

Publishing includes the stages of the development, acquisition, [[copy editing]], graphic design, production – [[printing]] (and its [[Electronic publishing|electronic equivalents]]), and [[marketing]] and [[distribution (business)|distribution]] of newspapers, magazines, books, [[literary work]]s, [[musical composition|musical work]]s, [[software]] and other works dealing with information, including the [[electronic media]].

[[Publication]] is also important as a [[law|legal concept]]:
#As the process of giving formal notice to the world of a significant intention, for example, to [[marry]] or enter [[bankruptcy]];
#As the essential precondition of being able to claim [[defamation]]; that is, the alleged [[libel]] must have been published, and
#For [[copyright]] purposes, where there is a difference in the protection of [[Edition (book)|published]] and unpublished works.

There are two categories of publisher:
#Non-Paid Publishers : The term non-paid publisher refers to those publication houses which do not charge author at all to publish the book.
#Paid Publishers : The author has to meet with the total expense to get the book published and author has full right to set up marketing policies. This is also known as vanity publishing.

==The process of publishing==
Book, magazines and newspapers publishers spend a lot of their time buying or commissioning copy; newspaper publishers, by contrast, usually hire their own staff to produce copy, although they may also employ freelance journalists, called [[Stringer (journalism)|stringers]]. At a small press, it is possible to survive by relying entirely on commissioned material. But as activity increases, the need for works may outstrip the publisher's established circle of writers.

For works written independently of the publisher, writers often first submit a query letter or proposal directly to a [[literary agent]] or to a publisher. Submissions sent directly to a publisher are referred to as unsolicited submissions, and the majority come from previously unpublished authors. If the publisher accepts unsolicited manuscripts, then the manuscript is placed in the [[slush pile]], which [[publisher's reader]]s sift through to identify manuscripts of sufficient quality or revenue potential to be referred to acquisitions editors for review. The acquisitions editors send their choices to the editorial staff. The time and number of people involved in the process is dependent on the size of the publishing company, with larger companies having more degrees of assessment between unsolicited submission and publication. Unsolicited submissions have a very low rate of acceptance, with some sources estimating that publishers ultimately choose about three out of every ten thousand unsolicited manuscripts they receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many book publishing companies around the world maintain a strict &quot;no unsolicited submissions&quot; policy and will only accept submissions via a literary agent. This shifts the burden of assessing and developing writers out of the publishing company and onto the literary agents. At these companies, unsolicited manuscripts are thrown out, or sometimes returned, if the author has provided pre-paid postage.

Established authors are often represented by a [[literary agent]] to market their work to publishers and negotiate contracts. Literary agents take a percentage of author earnings (varying between 10 to 15 percent) to pay for their services.

Some writers follow a non-standard route to publication. For example, this may include bloggers who have attracted large readerships producing a book based on their websites, books based on [[Internet memes]], instant &quot;celebrities&quot; such as [[Joe the Plumber]], retiring sports figures and in general anyone a publisher feels could produce a marketable book. Such books often employ the services of a [[ghostwriter]].

For a submission to reach publication it must be championed by an editor or publisher who must work to convince other staff of the need to publish a particular title. An editor who discovers or champions a book that subsequently becomes a best-seller may find their own reputation enhanced as a result of their success.

===Acceptance and negotiation===
Once a work is accepted, [[commissioning editors]] negotiate the purchase of [[intellectual property]] rights and agree on [[royalties|royalty]] rates.

The authors of traditional printed materials typically sell exclusive territorial intellectual property rights that match the list of countries in which distribution is proposed (i.e. the rights match the legal systems under which copyright protections can be enforced). In the case of books, the publisher and writer must also agree on the intended formats of publication — [[mass-market paperback]], &quot;trade&quot; [[paperback]] and [[hardback]] are the most common options.

The situation is slightly more complex, if electronic formatting is to be used. Where distribution is to be by [[CD-ROM]] or other physical media, there is no reason to treat this form differently from a paper format, and a national copyright is an acceptable approach. But the possibility of Internet download without the ability to restrict physical distribution within national boundaries presents legal problems that are usually solved by selling language or translation rights rather than national rights. Thus, Internet access across the [[European Union]] is relatively open because of the laws forbidding discrimination based on nationality, but the fact of publication in, say, France, limits the target market to those who read [[French language|French]].

Having agreed on the scope of the publication and the formats, the parties in a book agreement must then agree on [[royalty rate]]s, the percentage of the gross retail price that will be paid to the author, and the [[advance payment]]. This is difficult because the publisher must estimate the potential sales in each market and balance projected revenue against production costs. Royalties usually range between 10–12% of recommended retail price. An advance is usually 1/3 of first print run total royalties. For example, if a book has a print run of 5000 copies and will be sold at $14.95 and the author is to receive 10% royalties, the total sum payable to the author if all copies are sold is $7475 (10% x $14.95 x 5000). The advance in this instance would roughly be $2490. Advances vary greatly between books, with established authors commanding large advances.

===Pre-production stages===
Although listed as distinct stages, parts of these occur concurrently. As editing of text progresses, front cover design and initial layout takes place and sales and marketing of the book begins.

====Editorial stage====
A decision is taken to publish a work, and the technical legal issues resolved, the author may be asked to improve the quality of the work through rewriting or smaller changes, and the staff will [[editing|edit]] the work. Publishers may maintain a [[house style]], and staff will [[copy edit]] to ensure that the work matches the style and grammatical requirements of each market. Editors often choose or refine titles and headlines. Editing may also involve structural changes and requests for more information. Some publishers employ [[fact checker]]s, particularly regarding non-fiction works.

====Design stage====
When a final text is agreed upon, the next phase is [[design]]. This may include [[Visual arts|artwork]] being commissioned or confirmation of layout. In publishing, the word &quot;art&quot; also indicates photographs. Depending on the number of photographs required by the work, photographs may also be licensed from [[Stock photography|photo libraries]]. For those works that are particularly rich in illustrations the publisher may contract a picture researcher to find and license the photographs required for the work. The design process prepares the work for [[printing]] through processes such as [[typesetting]], dust jacket composition, specification of paper quality, binding method and casing, and [[proofreading]].

The type of book being produced determines the amount of design required. For standard fiction titles, design is usually restricted to typography and cover design. For books containing illustrations or images, design takes on a much larger role in laying out how the page looks, how chapters begin and end, colours, typography, cover design and ancillary materials such as posters, catalogue images and other sales materials. Non-fiction illustrated titles are the most design intensive books, requiring extensive use of images and illustrations, captions, typography and a deep involvement and consideration of the reader experience.

The activities of typesetting, page layout, the production of negatives, plates from the negatives and, for hardbacks, the preparation of brasses for the spine legend and [[imprint]] are now all computerized. Prepress computerization evolved mainly in about the last twenty years of the 20th century. If the work is to be distributed electronically, the final files are saved as formats appropriate to the target operating systems of the hardware used for reading. These may include [[PDF]] files.

====Sales and marketing stage====
The sales and marketing stage is closely intertwined with the editorial process. As front cover images are produced or chapters are edited, sales people may start talking about the book with their customers to build early interest. Publishing companies often produce advanced information sheets that may be sent to customers or overseas publishers to gauge possible sales. As early interest is measured, this information feeds back through the editorial process and may affect the formatting of the book and the strategy employed to sell it. For example, if interest from foreign publishers is high, co-publishing deals may be established whereby publishers share printing costs in producing large print runs thereby lowering the per-unit cost of the books. Conversely, if initial feedback is not strong, the print-run of the book may be reduced, the marketing budget cut or, in some cases, the book is dropped from publication altogether.

===Printing===
After the end of editing and design work the printing phase begins. The first step involves the production of a [[pre-press proof]], which the printers send for final checking and sign-off by the publisher. This proof shows the book precisely as it will appear once printed and represents the final opportunity for the publisher to find and correct any errors. Some printing companies use electronic proofs rather than printed proofs. Once the publisher has approved the proofs, printing – the physical production of the printed work – begins.

A new printing process has emerged as [[printing on demand]]. The book is written, edited, and designed as usual, but it is not printed until the publisher receives an order for the book from a customer. This procedure ensures low costs for storage, and reduces the likelihood of printing more books than will be sold.

===Binding===
{{main | Bibliopegy}}

In the case of books, binding follows upon the printing process. It involves folding the printed sheets, &quot;securing them together, affixing boards or sides thereto, and covering the whole with leather or other materials&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution===
The final stage in publication involves making the product available to the public, usually by offering it for sale. In previous centuries, authors frequently also acted as their own editor, printer, and bookseller, but these functions have generally become separated. Once a book, newspaper, or other publication is printed, the publisher may use a variety of channels to distribute it. Books are most commonly sold through [[bookselling|bookseller]]s and through other retailers. Newspapers and magazines are typically sold in advance directly by the publisher to [[subscriber]]s, and then distributed either through the postal system or by [[newspaper carrier]]s. Periodicals are also frequently sold through [[newsagent]]s and vending machines.

Within the book industry, printers often fly some copies of the finished book to publishers as sample copies to aid sales or to be sent out for pre-release reviews. The remaining books often travel from the printing facility via sea freight. Accordingly, the delay between the approval of the pre-press proof and the arrival of books in a warehouse, much less in a retail store, can take some months. For books that tie into movie release-dates (particularly for [[children's films]]), publishers will arrange books to arrive in store up to two months prior to the movie release in order to build interest in the movie.

==Publishing as a business==
[[File:ChungyoEslite fullsize.png|thumb|[[Eslite Bookstore]] in [[Taiwan]].]]

Derided in the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]] as &quot;a purely commercial affair&quot; that cared more about profits than about literary quality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; publishing is fundamentally a business, with a need for the expenses of creating, producing, and distributing a book or other publication not to exceed the income derived from its sale. Publishing is now a major industry with the largest companies  [[Reed Elsevier]] and [[Pearson PLC]] having global publishing operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industryanalysis.co.uk |title=Competitor &amp; Market Research &amp;#124; Every UK Sector |publisher=Industry Analysis |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publisher usually controls the [[advertising]] and other [[marketing]] tasks, but may [[subcontract]] various aspects of the process to specialist publisher marketing agencies. In many companies, editing, proofreading, layout, design and other aspects of the production process are done by [[freelancer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jobs and Careers – Help|publisher=Random House, Inc.|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/about/faq/index.php?ToDo=view&amp;questId=144&amp;catId=11|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jobs with Penguin|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd|url=http://gs12.globalsuccessor.com/fe/tpl_penguin01.asp?newms=info03#para2|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dedicated in-house salespeople are sometimes replaced by companies who specialize in sales to bookshops, wholesalers and chain stores for a fee. This trend is accelerating as retail book chains and supermarkets have centralized their buying.

If the entire process up to the stage of printing is handled by an outside company or individuals, and then sold to the publishing company, it is known as ''[[book packaging]]''. This is a common strategy between smaller publishers in different territorial markets where the company that first buys the intellectual property rights then sells a package to other publishers and gains an immediate return on capital invested. Indeed, the first publisher will often print sufficient copies for all markets and thereby get the maximum quantity efficiency on the print run for all.

Some businesses maximize their profit margins through [[vertical integration]]; book publishing is not one of them. Although newspaper and magazine companies still often own printing presses and binderies, book publishers rarely do. Similarly, the trade usually sells the finished products through a [[distributor]] who stores and distributes the publisher's wares for a percentage fee or sells on a sale or return basis.

The advent of the Internet has provided the electronic way of book distribution without the need of physical printing, physical delivery and storage of books. This therefore poses an interesting question that challenges publishers, distributors and retailers. The question pertains to the role and importance the publishing houses have in the overall publishing process. It is a common practice that the author, the original creator of the work, signs the contract awarding him or her only around 10% of the proceeds of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexbooks.net/publishingcontract.htm |title=Sample Publishing Contract |publisher=Indexbooks.net |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such contract leaves 90% of the book proceeds to the publishing houses and distribution companies. However, within the electronic book path the publishing house role is reduced to the proofreading. This raises the question of how reasonable is the practice that leaves them much higher percentage of proceeds than to the authors.

In 2005, [[Amazon.com]] announced its purchase of Booksurge and selfsanepublishing, a major [[print on demand]] operation. This is probably intended as a preliminary move towards establishing an Amazon [[imprint]].{{or|date=April 2012}} CreateSpace is the Amazon subsidiary that facilitates publishing by small presses and individual authors. Books published via create space are sold on Amazon and other outlets, with Amazon extracting a very high percentage of the sales proceeds for the services of publishing. printing and distributing.  One of the largest bookseller chains, Barnes &amp; Noble, already runs its own successful imprint with both new titles and classics — hardback editions of out-of-print former best sellers. Similarly, Ingram Industries, parent company of Ingram Book Group (a leading US book wholesaler), now includes its own print-on-demand division called Lightning Source. In 2013, Ingram launched a small press and self publishing arm called Ingram Spark.&lt;ref&gt;https://www1.ingramspark.com/Portal&lt;/ref&gt; Payment terms are much closer to those of Amazon and less favorable than those they offer to more established publishers via Lightning Source. Among publishers, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] recently announced that it will start selling its backlist titles directly to consumers through its website.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Book clubs are almost entirely direct-to-retail, and niche publishers pursue a mixed strategy to sell through all available outlets — their output is insignificant to the major booksellers, so lost revenue poses no threat to the traditional symbiotic relationships between the four activities of printing, publishing, distribution and retail.

==Industry sub-divisions==

===Newspaper publishing===
{{Main|Newspaper}}
Newspapers are regularly scheduled publications that present recent news, typically on a type of inexpensive paper called [[newsprint]]. Most newspapers are primarily sold to [[subscriber]]s, through retail news stands or are distributed as advertising-supported [[free newspaper]]s. About one-third of publishers in the United States are newspaper publishers.&lt;ref name=DOL&gt;{{cite web | title = Career Guide to Industries, 2010–11 Edition:  Publishing, Except Software | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm | publisher = U.S. Department of Labor | author = Bureau of Labor Statistics | date = 17 December 2009 | accessdate = 28 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Periodical publishing===
{{Main|Periodical publication}}
Nominally, periodical publishing involves publications that appear in a new edition on a regular schedule. Newspapers and magazines are both periodicals, but within the industry, the periodical publishing is frequently considered a separate branch that includes magazines and even [[academic journal]]s, but not newspapers.&lt;ref name=DOL /&gt;  About one-third of publishers in the United States publish periodicals (not including newspapers).&lt;ref name=DOL /&gt;

===Book publishing===
{{See also|History of books}}
Book publishers represent less than a sixth of the publishers in the United States.&lt;ref name=DOL /&gt; Most books are published by a small number of very large book publishers, but thousands of smaller book publishers exist. Many small- and medium-sized book publishers specialize in a specific area. Additionally, thousands of authors have created their own publishing companies, and self-published their own works.

Within the book publishing industry, the '''publisher of record''' for a book is the entity in whose name the book's [[ISBN]] is registered. The publisher of record may or may not be the actual publisher.

Approximately 60%&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/drm-lawsuit-independent-bookstores-amazon_n_2727519.html&lt;/ref&gt; of English-language books are produced through the &quot;Big Six&quot; publishing houses: [[Random House]], [[Penguin Books|Penguin]], [[Hachette Book Group USA|Hachette]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] and [[Macmillan]]. 
See also [[List of English-language book publishing companies]]

===Directory publishing===
Directory publishing is a specialized genre within the publishing industry. These publishers produce mailing lists, [[telephone book]]s, and other types of directories.&lt;ref name=DOL /&gt; With the advent of the Internet, many of these directories are now online.

===Academic publishing===
{{Main|Academic publishing}}
Academic publishers are typically either book or periodical publishers that have specialized in academic subjects. Some, like [[university presses]], are owned by scholarly institutions. Others are commercial businesses that focus on academic subjects.

The development of the [[printing press]] represented a revolution for communicating the latest hypotheses and research results to the academic community and supplemented what a scholar could do personally. But this improvement in the efficiency of communication created a challenge for libraries, which have had to accommodate the weight and volume of literature.

One of the key functions that academic publishers provide is to manage the process of [[peer review]]. Their role is to facilitate the impartial assessment of research and this vital role is not one that has yet been usurped, even with the advent of social networking and online document sharing.

Today, publishing academic journals and textbooks is a large part of an international industry. Critics claim that standardised accounting and profit-oriented policies have displaced the publishing ideal of providing access to all. In contrast to the commercial model, there is [[non-profit]] publishing, where the publishing organization is either organised specifically for the purpose of publishing, such as a [[university press]], or is one of the functions of an organisation such as a medical charity, founded to achieve specific practical goals. An alternative approach to the corporate model is [[Open access (publishing)|open access]], the online distribution of individual articles and academic journals without charge to readers and libraries. The pioneers of Open Access journals are [[BioMed Central]] and the Public Library of Science ([[PLoS]]). Many commercial publishers are experimenting with hybrid models where older articles or government funded articles are made free, and newer articles are available as part of a subscription or individual article purchase.

===Tie-in publishing===
Technically, radio, television, cinemas, VCDs and DVDs, music systems, games, computer hardware and mobile telephony publish information to their audiences. Indeed, the marketing of a major film often includes a [[novelization]], a graphic novel or comic version, the soundtrack album, a game, model, toys and endless promotional publications.

Some of the major publishers have entire divisions devoted to a single franchise, e.g. Ballantine Del Rey Lucasbooks has the exclusive rights to ''Star Wars'' in the United States; Random House UK (Bertelsmann)/Century LucasBooks holds the same rights in the United Kingdom. The game industry self-publishes through BL Publishing/[[Black Library]] ([[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer]]) and Wizards of the Coast ([[Dragonlance]], [[Forgotten Realms]], etc.). The BBC has its own publishing division that does very well with long-running series such as [[Doctor Who]]. These multimedia works are cross-marketed aggressively and sales frequently outperform the average stand-alone published work, making them a focus of corporate interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;cave&quot;&gt;Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed), &quot;Caves of the Thousand Buddhas&quot;, 1990, British Museum publications, ISBN 0-7141-1447-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent publishing alternatives===
{{See also|Alternative media}}

Writers in a specialized field or with a narrower appeal have found smaller alternatives to the mass market in the form of [[small press]]es and [[self-publishing]]. More recently, these options include [[print on demand]] and [[ebook]] format. These publishing alternatives provide an avenue for authors who believe that mainstream publishing will not meet their needs or who are in a position to make more money from direct sales than they could from [[bookstore]] sales, such as popular speakers who sell books after speeches. Authors are more readily published by this means due to the much lower costs involved.

==Recent developments==
The 21st century has brought a number of new technological changes to the publishing industry. These changes include [[e-books]], [[print on demand]] and [[accessible publishing]]. E-books have been quickly growing in availability in major publishing markets such as the USA and the UK since 2005. [[Google]], [[Amazon.com]] and [[Sony]] have been leaders in working with publishers and libraries to digitize books. As of early 2011 Amazon's [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] reading device is a significant force in the market, along with the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPad]] and the [[Barnes &amp; Noble Nook|Nook]] from [[Barnes &amp; Noble]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Along with the growing popularity of e-books, some companies like [[Oyster (company)|Oyster]] and [[Scribd]] have pursued the subscription model, providing members unlimited access to a content library on a variety of digital reading devices.

The ability to quickly and cost-effectively [[Print on Demand]] has meant that publishers no longer have to store books at warehouses, if the book is in low or unknown demand. This is a huge advantage to small publishers who can now operate without large overheads and large publishers who can now cost-effectively sell their backlisted items.

[[Accessible publishing]] uses the digitization of books to mark up books into [[XML]] and then produces multiple formats from this to sell to consumers, often targeting those with difficulty reading. Formats include a variety larger print sizes, specialized print formats for [[dyslexia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/making-reading-easier/ |title=Making Reading Easier – Paper Cuts Blog |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=May 20, 2008&lt;!--, 4:26 pm --&gt;|author=Dwight Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt; eye tracking problems and [[macular degeneration]], as well as [[Braille]], [[DAISY]], [[Audiobooks]] and [[e-books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readhowyouwant.com/Technology/overview.aspx |title=Overview of the Technology- Awards, Cost Savings|publisher=Radhowyouwant.com|accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green publishing means adapting the publishing process to minimise environmental impact. One example of this is the concept of on-demand printing, using digital or print-on-demand technology. This cuts down the need to ship books since they are manufactured close to the customer on a just-in-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kanter |first=James |url=http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/reading-green-on-demand/?scp=1&amp;sq=green%20publishing%20toby&amp;st=cse |title=Reading Green On Demand - NYTimes.com |publisher=Greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2008-12-02 |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further development is the growth of on-line publishing where no physical books are produced. The ebook is created by the author and uploaded to a website from where it can be downloaded and read by anyone.

An increasing number of small authors are using [[niche marketing]] online to sell more books by engaging with their readers online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Rinzler |title=The Magic of Niche Marketing for Authors |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/booked/2010/07/29/the-magic-of-niche-marketing-for-authors/ |work=[[Forbes]] |date=2010-07-29 |accessdate=2012-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Publication}}

Publication is the distribution of copies or [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] to the [[General public|public]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=WIPO |url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P98_14701 |title=Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works |publisher=Wipo.int |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ucc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/copyrights/The%20Universal%20Copyright%20Convention%20_Geneva%20Text--September.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – The Universal Copyright Convention _Geneva Text—September­ |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] requires that this can only be done with the consent of the copyright holder, which is initially always the author.&lt;ref name=&quot;bc&quot;/&gt;  In the [[Universal Copyright Convention]], &quot;publication&quot; is defined in article VI as &quot;the reproduction in tangible form and the general distribution to the public of copies of a work from which it can be read or otherwise visually perceived.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ucc&quot;/&gt;

In providing a work to the general public, the publisher takes responsibility for the publication in a way that a mere printer or a shopkeeper does not. For example, publishers may face charges of [[defamation]], if they produce and distribute libelous material to the public, even if the libel was written by another person.

==Privishing==
[[Censorship#Privishing|Privishing]] ('''priv'''ate publ'''ishing''')  is a recently coined term for publishing a book in such a small amount, or with such lack of marketing, advertising or sales support from the publisher, that the book effectively does not reach the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Clive Jacobs''' is a British businessman and entrepreneur.

He is best known for co-founding Holiday Autos Group, the first car rental broker in Europe, which he and his partners Nick Stolberg and Gary Bacon set up in 1988 and subsequently sold to [[lastminute.com]] plc. He is the owner and chairman of London-based publishing brands [[Travel Weekly (UK)]] and [[Caterer and Hotelkeeper]].

==Early career==
Jacobs’ first jobs included stints on building sites and in the fish department at [[Selfridges]]. His first role in the travel industry was as a messenger for a travel company. By the age of 21 he had set up and become managing director of his own flight company.

==Holiday Autos==
In the late 1980s Jacobs and his partners spotted a gap in the car rental market, noticing that the sector was geared primarily for business travellers and not holidaymakers.

In 1987, Nick Stolberg and Gary Bacon founded Holicars and Sundrive. In 1988 they came together with Clive Jacobs and founded Holiday Autos, offering a pre-bookable, pre-paid, fully inclusive product that was the first company in the travel industry to offer a John Lewis-style price guarantee, pledging to be never knowingly undersold.

In 1995, Jacobs bought out his Holiday Autos partners with the assistance of ECI Ventures. Holiday Autos went on to become a significant global operation, with sales offices in 30 countries. In 1999 it launched the first fully transactional car rental website. By 2003, when the company was sold, it had won 68 awards in eight countries for both service and innovation.

Jacobs became known to the wider public when he and staff at Holiday Autos’ headquarters were the subject of a three-part BBC2 documentary, ''The Secret Life of The Office'', broadcast in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = British Film Institute TV Database | year = 2002| url = http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/37446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Jacobs sold Holiday Autos to lastminute.com for £43 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = BBC News Channel ''Lastminute buys car hire firm'' | date = March 26, 2003| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2889615.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other business interests==
In 2007, Jacobs took a 50% interest in freeads.co.uk, an online classified website.

Jacobs bought the Michelin-starred New Angel restaurant and rooms in Dartmouth, Devon, out of administration and reinstated [[John Burton Race]] as executive head chef. Jacobs and Burton Race had first worked together in 1992 when Jacobs was chairman and co-owner of [[L'Ortolan]] in Shinfield, Berkshire. In 2010 Jacobs sold the New Angel business to Richard Pursey and Alan Murchison of the 10 in 8 Fine Dining Group while retaining the premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Caterer and Hotelkeeper ''John Burton Race to reopen his Michelin-starred restaurant in Devon | date = February 21, 2008| url = http://www.catererandhotelkeeper.co.uk/Articles/21/2/2008/319067/john-burton-race-to-reopen-his-michelin-starred-restaurant-in-devon.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Jacobs founded [[Travel Weekly Group]] as a vehicle to acquire [[Travel Weekly (UK)]] and its associated brands gazetteers.com and Travolution and their websites and events portfolio from [[Reed Business Information]] (part of [[Reed Elsevier]] plc).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Telegraph ''Holiday Autos founder picks up travel unit from Reed Elsevier'' | date = July 9, 2009| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/5789473/Holiday-Autos-founder-picks-up-travel-unit-from-Reed-Elsevier.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is chairman and owner of the group.

In 2012, Jacobs, along with former Thomas Cook executive and entrepreneur Terry Fisher, approached [[Thomas Cook Group]], the second-largest holidays company in the UK, with £400 million of committed institutional shareholder funds for an emergency rescue of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Times ''When even £400m fails to bring sunshine'' | date = March 16, 2012| url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/leisure/article3353819.ece }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, Jacobs acquired ''Caterer and Hotelkeeper'', also from Reed Business Information, operating it as a standalone but sister publishing operation to Travel Weekly Group. Both ventures are based in the same building in Victoria, London, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Press Gazette ''Caterer and Hotelkeeper sold to owner of Travel Weekly Group'' | date = October 17, 2012| url = http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/caterer-and-hotelkeeper-sold-owner-travel-weekly-group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards ==
Jacobs has won several industry accolades, including:
*World Travel Market Global Award – for outstanding contribution to the UK travel industry (1997) 
*PwC and Decision Magazine Director of the Year Award (1999) 
*World Travel Market Tribute 21 Award – for pioneering change in the travel industry over the previous 21 years (2000) 
*Inducted into the UK travel industry’s Hall of Fame (2003)

==Other interests ==
Since 1993, Jacobs has been a patron of the Teenage Cancer Trust.

In 2008, Jacobs was appointed the first chairman of Visit Devon, a newly formed destination management organisation responsible for promoting Devon to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = This is South Devon ''Jacobs takes chair to promote Devon'' | date = September 12, 2008| url = http://www.thisissouthdevon.co.uk/Jacobs-takes-chair-promote-Devon/story-12364433-detail/story.html#axzz2UhVi0vPG }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tsehai Publishers''' is an independent, academic press based at [[Loyola Marymount University]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsehai Publishers History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsehai Publishers: History|url=http://academics.lmu.edu/marymount/tsehai/history/|work=Marymount Institute Official Site|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The press focuses primarily on indigenous African knowledge production, and in particular subjects relating to [[Ethiopia]]. It has various imprints, and is run by its founder, exiled Ethiopian journalist and publisher Elias Wondimu.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsehai Publishers History&quot;/&gt;

== History ==
Wondimu founded Tsehai Publishers in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Weekly&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Anthony|title=Ethiopian Dreams|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2005-06-02/art-books/ethiopian-dreams/full/|work=LA Weekly|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1998 to 2001, he ran the company while also working full-time, as managing editor of the [[Ethiopian Review]] and for UCLA-based Chicano journal [[Aztlán]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Weekly&quot;/&gt;  In an interview with Tadias Magazine, Wondimu explained the inception of Tsehai Publishers. “Living in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s, I noticed a major void in the publishing field on the subject of Ethiopia. Hardly any literature was available on Ethiopia, and what was there was seriously incomplete and flawed. I was tired of waiting for change to happen, and decided to take matters into my own hands.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Tadias Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A with Elias Wondimu of Tsehai Publishers|url=http://www.tadias.com/02/02/2012/q-a-with-elias-wondimu-of-tsehai-publishers/|work=Tadias Magazine|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wondimu explains, “In 2001, I left a job at [[UCLA]] and began running Tsehai full time. Since then Tsehai has published over 60 books, started three academic journals, and founded three imprints—African Academic Press, Marymount Institute Press and Chereka Books.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Tadias Interview&quot;/&gt;

In 2008, Tsehai moved its headquarters to Marymount Institute, at [[Loyola Marymount University]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Together, Wondimu and Marymount Institute Director Dr. Theresia de Vroom founded Marymount Institute Press, an imprint dedicated to upholding the tenets of the Marian tradition. The Press has “a commitment to artistic diversity, social justice, internationality, and knowledge production.”&lt;ref name=&quot;About MIP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Marymount Institute Press|url=http://academics.lmu.edu/marymount/marymountpress/about/|work=Marymount Institute Official Site|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Tsehai Publishers launched a new venture, Tsehai Films, a production company through which it plans to release documentary films exploring subjects such as media bias and perception of [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsehai Films FB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsehai Films Official Facebook Page|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tsehai-Films/416974551740823|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tsehai Films released two short films on Vimeo in 2013, one exploring photographer Robert Radin’s philosophies on art and life, the other looking at the way in which English scholars Richard and Rita Pankhurst made Ethiopia their home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsehai Films Vimeo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsehai Films|url=http://vimeo.com/tsehaifilms|work=Official Tsehai Films Vimeo|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mengistu Hailemariam Scandal ===
In January 2012, the website Debteraw.com posted a pirated copy of Ethiopian politician [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]’s memoir, which was slated for release by Tsehai that same winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine Article&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Donald N|title=Illegal PDF of Mengistu Haile Mariam’s Memoir|url=http://www.tadias.com/02/01/2012/ethiopia-illegal-pdf-of-mengistu-haile-mariams-memoir/|work=Tadias Magazine|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK-based site is affiliated with the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party]], a [[Marxist]] group.

The electronic distribution of the book was an act of protest against Tsehai’s decision to publish the volume. Debteraw.com released the following statement in the wake of its actions: “Mass murderer and brutal dictator Mengsitu Haile Mariam (exiled in Harare, Zimbabwe) has written a 500+ pages book that has been published by Tsehai Publisher[s] of Los Angeles. This mass murderer has not yet atoned or paid for his horrendous crimes and the mass killings of the Red Terror. He now hopes to benefit from the sale of his book of lies. We strongly feel that this criminal should be tried before a court of law and should be hindered from benefiting from his crime. Thus, we have published the book in PDF and we are posting it for free usage of all interested readers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tadias Interview&quot;/&gt;

Wondimu responded to the actions of Debteraw.com by saying, “Professional publishers publish books coming from various political and ideological quarters and by people who have been involved in all kinds of activities. This does not mean publishers agree with the contents of the book they publish. Publishers are not politicians or judges. They are not agents of censorship. They believe in freedom of expression, in the intelligence of the reading public, its capacity to separate the wheat from the chaff and to make informed judgments. This is precisely the perspective of Tsehai publishers also.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Tadias Interview&quot;/&gt;

== Mission ==
From Tsehai's section of the Marymount Institute website: “Tsehai Publishers exists to give voice to otherwise voiceless writers, cultures, peoples, histories, nations, and regions.

Tsehai Publishers exists to provide a platform for indigenous African knowledge production -- to create an alternative, honest, homegrown narrative of Africa divorced from the cultural bias, value judgements, and historical interpretation and misinformation pervading Western media.

Tsehai Publishers exists to provide the next generation of African leaders and thinkers access to their own cultural, historical, and academic heritage.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsehai Mission&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsehai Publishers: Mission|url=http://academics.lmu.edu/marymount/tsehai/mission/|work=Marymount Institute Official Website|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Tsehai publishers new books and re-publishes rare, out-of-print, and hard-to-find volumes of some importance.
	
=== New Books ===
Tsehai publishes several new volumes each year, ranging in nature from biographies (''Soaring on Winged Verse: The Life of Ethiopian Poet Playwright Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin'') to history (''Haile Selassie’s Government''), political volumes (''A Political History of the Tigray People's Liberation Front Revolt, Ideology, and Mobilization in Ethiopia''), and memoirs (''Ethiopian Reminiscences'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soaring on Winged Verse|url=http://store.tsehaipublishers.com/product_info.php?products_id=112|work=Tsehai Publishers Webstore|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haile Selassie's Government|url=http://store.tsehaipublishers.com/product_info.php?products_id=111|work=Tsehai Publishers Webstore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Political History of the Tigray People's Liberation Front|url=http://store.tsehaipublishers.com/product_info.php?products_id=48|work=Tsehai Publishers Webstore|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopian Reminiscenes|url=http://store.tsehaipublishers.com/product_info.php?products_id=113|work=Tsehai Publishers Webstore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the company is prepping the publication of its first two coffee table books, ''Flowers of Today, Seeds of Tomorrow'' and ''Uniting a Continent: The OAU at 50''.&lt;ref name=&quot;academics.lmu.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsehai Publishers: Upcoming &amp; Recent Books|url=http://academics.lmu.edu/marymount/tsehai/upcoming/|work=Marymount Institute Official Site|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former is a book of profiles of prominent Ethiopians of the diaspora, those who left their home country and found professional and personal success in their new adopted homes. The book exists as a means of combating media bias against Ethiopia while also inspiring a young generation of Ethiopians the world over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flowers of Today, Seeds of Tomorrow Campaign|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tsehai/coffee-table-book-flowers-of-today-seeds-of-tomorr|work=Kickstarter|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wondimu|first=Elias|title=7 Ethiopian Women to Watch|url=http://www.msafropolitan.com/2012/11/7-ethiopian-women-to-watch.html|work=Ms. Afropolitan|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Uniting a Continent'' is a celebration of the [[Organisation for African Unity]] on its 50th anniversary. The book highlights the positive aspects of the Organization, and contains profiles of the attendees of the first session of the OUA in 1963, newly commissioned portraits of those profiled, information in each member country, historical photographs, and text of speeches given at the first session.&lt;ref name=&quot;academics.lmu.edu&quot;/&gt;

=== Republished Volumes ===
Tsehai has republished numerous out-of-print or hard-to-find books of some importance to Ethiopian or [[African studies]].

Levine]]'s ''Wax &amp; Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopian Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic History of Ethiopia (1800 - 1935)|url=http://store.tsehaipublishers.com/product_info.php?products_id=109|work=Tsehai Publishers Webstore|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wax &amp; Gold|url=http://store.tsehaipublishers.com/product_info.php?products_id=70|work=Tsehai Publishers Webstore|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
=== International Journal of Ethiopian Studies ===
Tsehai Publishers’ International Journal of [[Ethiopian Studies]] (IJES)is a bi-annual publication containing scholarship on Ethiopian history, culture, politics, and more. The journal contains new scholarship in English and Amharic, as well as newly translated pieces, poetry, important government documents, and other relevant pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Journal of Ethiopian Studies|url=http://store.tsehaipublishers.com/index.php?cPath=23_41|work=Tsehai Publishers Webstore|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Journal of Ethiopian Studies|url=http://www.jstor.org/action/showPublication?journalCode=intejethistud&amp;|work=JSTOR|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The December 2012 issue of IJES contained recently declassified documents written by [[Henry Kissinger]] for then president [[Richard Nixon]] in anticipation of Ethiopian emperor [[Halie Selassie]]’s arrival in [[Washington DC]] on a diplomatic mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IJES: VI; 1&amp;2 - Content|url=http://store.tsehaipublishers.com/product_info.php?products_id=108#!tab2|work=Tsehai Publishers Webstore|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''Ann Mroz ''' is a British-Polish journalist, former editor of [[Times Higher Education]] and current editor and digital publishing director of the TES ([[Times Educational Supplement]]).

== Early career ==
 
Ann Mroz’s early career was spent in music journalism and as a freelance writer.
 
== TSL Education ==
 
Ann Mroz joined the Times Higher Education Supplement in 1994 as a sub-editor.  She became chief sub-editor and deputy editor before being appointed editor of ''THE'' in May 2008. During her time at the ''THES'', she was instrumental in overseeing the transition of title from a broadsheet newspaper supplement to a rebranded [[Times Higher Education]] magazine. 
 
It was also under Mroz’s tenure that the magazine’s annual [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] took the decision to change data supplier from Quacquerelli Symonds to [[Thomson Reuters]]. Explaining the decision, taken after the publication of the 2009 rankings, she said that “universities deserve a rigorous, robust and transparent set of rankings – a serious tool for the sector, not just an annual curiosity.” She went on to explain the reason behind the decision to continue to produce rankings without QS’ involvement, saying that: “The responsibility weighs heavy on our shoulders...we feel we have a duty to improve how we compile them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mroz |first=Ann |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=408968&amp;c=1 |title=Leader: Only the best for the best |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2011 ''Times Higher Education'' was awarded the titles of “Weekly Business Magazine of the Year” and “Media Business Brand of the Year” by the [[Professional Publishers Association]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theppaawards.com/ |title=PPA Awards 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Mroz was promoted to digital publishing director of TES Resources in January 2012. During this time, the company has expanded to include three new sites: [[Share My Lesson]], [[TES India]] and [[TES Australia]]. She also helped to transition the [[Times Educational Supplement]] in its rebrand, which included the move from a newspaper to a magazine format.
 
In the ''TES'' issue of 9 August 2013, it was announced that the title’s current editor, Gerard Kelly, would be stepping down and that Mroz would be his successor. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6347180 |title=TES – News at a glance}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became editor on 1 September 2013 and currently holds both this title and that of digital publishing director within the company.
 
She is a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and a member of the Princeton University Press European advisory board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/europe/content/pages/advisory_board.html |title= Princeton University Press European advisory board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Pubcycle2.gif|thumb|alt=Alt text|A visual representation of the publication cycle]] --&gt;
'''Publication cycle''' is the process through which [[author]]s take their ideas and put them into viewable form. This includes all forms of [[publication]], from initial [[research report]]s, to [[article (publishing)|articles]] posted on [[website]]s, and the commonly recognized [[magazine]] articles and [[book]]s.

==Publication process==
===Idea===
The cycle begins with the authors deciding on what topic they wish to publish about. This can be a very quick step for some authors, who decided on a topic and develop it more later in the process, or the author can take a large amount of time fully developing a complete idea.

===Research===
This is when authors take their ideas and find out all the information that is readily available. For [[scientific publication]], this includes previously done experiments as well has conducting more experiments that focus mainly on the chosen topic. For literary authors, this step includes reading previous publications and to see if any other authors have published work similar to theirs.

===Informal communication===
Informal communication is when authors get together and exchange ideas without there being any formal purposes or any structured agenda to guide them along. This includes dinners, going to the bar, [[phone call]]s, parties, and small gatherings.

===Idea protection===
Idea protection is when authors formalize their ideas and reserve their rights to them. This includes [[patent]]s, [[copyright]], trademark, [[registered trademark]]s, and [[Creative Commons|creative commons]]. It is important for authors to protect their work so that others do not take credit for their work.

===Report findings===
This can be done in many different ways. There are formal reports, such as lab reports, research documents, and other [[white paper]] publications. Informal versions include posts on person web pages, blogs, and new forms like [[facebook]] posts.

===Conferences===
These meetings include both formal and inform forms of communication and are great ways not only to present your findings but also begin the cycle. Presentations and discussions are held to publicize research.

===Magazines and newspapers===
One of the more public and common types of publications, these are one of the most popular types of printed publications. These are used at many levels such as small towns, college [[campus]]es, and regional or national levels.

===Journal articles===
These vary a lot throughout their process, but they generally have the same objective in mind: to present an idea or position These can range from a personal to corporate journal and have many various subjects. Depending on the level, the journal article may be peer-reviewed by others in the field or a dedicated editing staff.
* Examples
* The Wall Street Journal
* Personal Diary

===Book publication===
This is possibly one of the longest processes due to the many levels of review that go into the production of a [[book]]. There are usually many editions of books because each must be reviewed and revised before it actually goes into production. Also, many revisions to manuscripts may be made because of grammatical errors or a focus that needs to be fleshed out in more detail.

===Government documents===
There are many varieties of these documents. They can range from bills, deeds, [[constitution]]s or government contracts. These carry the most complexity with them because it must be kept updated regularly to reflect the current version of the document. Amendments to government documents make these documents have a longer publication cycle than most other documents because they must constantly be revised and it has to publicly be known that an [[wikt:amendment|amendment]] has been added and usually there are a series of checks these documents must pass through before their publication cycle has ended.

==Types of publication==
===Written publication types===
====Research reports====
These are published when authors do experiments to help support their topics. Reports are generally a formal type of publications, but it depends on the author. Some authors simply publish research findings, without any detailed explanations or formal papers. Other authors will write up full reports, with all the findings, calculations, and conclusions drawn from the information found.

====Conference papers====
Conference papers are published following [[Meeting|conferences]]. Authors find these helpful, not only for reviewing what happened during the conference, but also finding out what happened at conferences they were unable to attend.

====Magazine and newspaper article====
Magazines and [[newspaper]]s are some of the most commonplace publications that people think of. They are the main source of recent, up to date information that affects everyday life. These types of media are generally published from a day to a week after the event being reported on occurred..

====Journal article====
Journals are slower to publish information, but are more reputable that magazines and newspapers. Journals go through a much more formal and strict review process to ensure that the information is authenticated and trustworthy.

====Book====
Books are the key publication type, used not only for information, but also telling stories, listing facts, and sharing opinions. Books go through a very long revision process which makes sure not only that all errors in the writing have been fixed, but also that there are no copyright infringements.

====Encyclopedia====
[[Encyclopedia]]s are similar to books because they have a complicated revision process, but because of the information contained in encyclopedias and because they are periodicals, they are different in how they function. When encyclopedias are republished, all that changes is the information that has been proven wrong or has altered since the last publication. But even so, they are not normally published more than once a year.

====Online publication types====
=====Blogs=====
These are simply people or a [[corporation]]'s ideas that are published throughout the internet. These are not usually edited and usually have the most interaction with readers. They usually employ comment boxes that allow for people to comment on. The more followers the [[blog]] has, the more credible it appears.

=====Forums=====
These are usually for support or posting reviews and specific questions about a specific product or brand.

=====E-Books=====
See books.

E-Books are simply books that have been digitally scanned and posted online.

=====Personal website=====
Usually hosted by an individual. It usually reflects the interest of that individual and can have any variety content they see fit to host and have the rights to host.

=====Corporate and government websites=====
These are usually contributed to expressly by employees of a particular company or department of the government. There is usually a small amount of funding that is solely devoted to the internet division of a particular camp. There is also a need to have servers and a large financial cost can be incurred due to the bandwidth that is needed because of the traffic that may travel to the page.

=====Tutorials=====
These are simply videos or texts that demonstrate how to perform a particular task. These can be a part of a larger site, such as Youtube.com, where users are able to post content that other may critique and view.

'''The Maestro Concept''' is a [[time-management]] technique in journalism designed to assist a newsroom in creating a project-based, teamwork-intensive approach to quality reporting and presentation of news stories by &quot;thinking like a reader.&quot;

The Maestro Concept begins with a “great story idea” that is generated through collaborative idea-group meetings to shape stories before they are written and integrates writing, editing, photography, art and design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timharrower.com/PDFs/printmaestro.pdf/ Package Planning, Teamwork Can Help Turn Stories into Appealing Packages] PDF&lt;/ref&gt; The Maestro Concept is not applied to all stories all the time. The concept applies only to those stories that are integrated with photographs, design elements and information graphics. It is a method designed to improve presentation of important stories through teamwork that brings the story to life and results in high impact and high readership.

==History==

The Maestro Concept created by Leland “Buck” Ryan, now director of the Citizen Kentucky Project of the Scripps Howard First Amendment Center and tenured associate professor of journalism at the University of Kentucky’s School of Journalism and Telecommunications. Ryan created the concept in the early 1990s when he was an assistant professor at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. The inspiration for the Maestro Concept came from a 1991 Poynter Institute study by Dr. Mario Garcia and Dr. Pegie Stark called “Eyes on the News.” That study followed the eyes of readers (tracked actual eye movements) in three cities and discovered that readers do not read a newspaper as journalists believed. This study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poynter.org/archived/about-poynter/81253/looking-back-at-eyetrack-poynters-history-of-studying-reader-habits/ Eyes on the News]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent studies, including online publications, are used in newsrooms and classrooms today as a teaching model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1PQTj4YFUT0C&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;dq=The+Editor's+Toolbox+Chapter+8+Maestro&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D-2gRtSVW4&amp;sig=gg7bn5hzCJ0yrnmCQCX9WsqdGK0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kq0cT_m0KMH5gge5r-X7CQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA |title=The Editor's Toolbox: A Reference Guide for Beginners and Professionals – Buck Ryan, Michael J. O'Donnell – Google Books |page=257 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original study found that good indexing for busy readers is the key to successful publishing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/newsgathering-storytelling/eyes-on-the-news/2424/good-indexing-key-to-successful-publications/ good indexing]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maestro Concept was developed through an “approach to newsroom management, organization and operation that applies [[W. Edwards Deming]]'s management principles used in manufacturing to the creative process.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=1PQTj4YFUT0C&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Capproach+to+newsroom+management,+organization+and+operation+that+applies+W.+Edwards+Deming%E2%80%99s+management+principles+used+in+manufacturing+to+the+creative+process.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D-2gXvJZY-&amp;sig=vkCE4qreBJQnGCTlg7V-4-Znce4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6QEmT77pFI3qtgfqotivCA&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Capproach%20to%20newsroom%20management%2C%20organization%20and%20operation%20that%20applies%20W.%20Edwards%20Deming%E2%80%99s%20management%20principles%20used%20in%20manufacturing%20to%20the%20creative%20process.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false The Maestro Concept, What is it?]&lt;/ref&gt; Striving for quality, in both product and management, is Deming’s focal point. As a statistician, Deming noted that when management focused primarily on costs, that approach over the long run drove up costs and diminished quality. Deming found that a focus by management to increase quality while reducing costs through reduction of waste and rework lowered costs in the long run. Continual improvement of the system, and not by bits and pieces, is integral to Deming's principles.

The Maestro Concept debuted in April 1993 at the [[American Society of News Editors]] convention in Baltimore, Maryland. After the debut, a list of 324 newspapers in the United States, in 59 newspaper groups, and more than 50 universities and high schools showed interest in the concept by purchasing a report and video entitled &quot;The Maestro Concept: A New Approach to Writing and Editing for the Newspaper of the Future.&quot; The concept's impact covers 48 states and Washington, D.C., and 16 other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky  School of Journalism [http://jat.uky.edu/about/faculty-information/journalism/item/122-buck-ryan.html?tmpl=component&amp;print=1 Buck Ryan]&lt;/ref&gt;

A part of the international impact was a maestro workshop conducted in [[Hanoi]] for Vietnamese print and online journalists in December 2006 by Buck Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jat.uky.edu/about/faculty-information/journalism/item/122-buck-ryan.html?tmpl=component&amp;print=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, three Russian journalism organizations invited Ryan to speak on the concept during 12 days of seminars: one was in Barnaul for the Press Development Institute-Siberia, a second in Kirov for the Russian Union of Journalists, and a third in Rostov-on-Don for the Alliance of Independent Regional Publishers of Russia. The director of the Press Development Institute-Siberia in Barnaul wrote that Ryan's &quot;ideas spurred numerous projects that our regional newspapers are eager to carry out as soon as possible.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://kykernel.com/2010/07/29/ryan-presents-maestro-concept-citizen-kentucky-project-to-russian-journalists-professors/ Ryan presents Maestro Concept, ‘Citizen Kentucky’ project to Russian journalists, professors]&lt;/ref&gt; Then in July, Ryan visited and served as the first journalism professor in residence as he taught two journalism courses in China for three weeks at [[Shanghai University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://bizlex.com/2012/03/hot-off-the-press/ CHROIX, “Hot Off The Press” Business Lexington, Retrieved 2012-05-27 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

High schools have increasingly used the Maestro Concept to introduce students on how a newsroom operates. The online [http://www.hsj.org/ High School Journalism Initiative] has lesson plans devoted to introducing high school students to the concept. One lesson plan titled “conducting the orchestra: how to implement maestro” details how students can be taught to build small teams that are able to motivate, be productive and encourage quality throughout the school year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsj.org/modules/lesson_plans/detail.cfm?menu_id=&amp;submenu_id=&amp;module_id=2&amp;LessonPlanId=404 Conducting the “Orchestra:” How to Implement Maestro]&lt;/ref&gt; High schools have reported that since the concept was introduced, students who have never before worked together find that they can coordinate fully reported stories and photos in one day. Besides meeting deadlines, students working together see that their story packages are of higher quality and often have a greater page presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psj.franklincollege.edu/Workshops/The%20Maestro%20Concept.html The maestro concept]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The Maestro Concept&quot; is presented in and is the title of Chapter Eight in the 2001 book, ''The Editor’s Toolbox, A Reference Guide for Beginners and Professionals''. Ryan co-authored the book with Michael O'Donnell.

==Concept and quotations==
The Maestro Concept is a time-management technique for story planning and newsroom organization through team collaboration to shape stories early before they are written. The central concept is trying to anticipate readers’ questions about news stories (“think like a reader”) and then answering those questions as quickly as possible through visual aspects with high-visibility points such as photos, headlines, captions and [[information graphics]]. It is a management technique to encourage collaboration across news departments and ensure that quality work in a story package comes not from the traditional method of an assembly-line process, but from teamwork and good time-management from all players working on the story.

By connecting the different roles in a newsroom, a Maestro congeals the story planning process and pulls it all together by integrating the separate work done by writers, photographers, graphic designers and editors. These members will meet together in a maestro session and they will coordinate the story line and graphic design layout of how the story will be presented to readers.

{{Quotation|&quot;Reinventing the Newsroom&quot; by Carl Sessions Stepp from the ''American Journalism Review'':
*A guru in this area is Buck Ryan of the University of Kentucky ... His system involves a coordinating editor (the maestro), who convenes writer, copy editor and designer, very early in the process, to discuss story focus, illustration and packaging.

*&quot;Ryan says that if you allow everyone – from the editor to the library researcher – to contribute, and let the story idea drive the organization of the newsroom, then you break through.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reinventing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=1677 |title= Reinventing the Newsroom – Carl Sessions Stepp |publisher= American Journalism Review ajr.org |date= April 1995|accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''1. Idea-group meetings'''

Generating story ideas is traditionally a job assigned to editors, but with the Maestro
Concept an idea-group meeting contains reporters, copy editors, photographers, designers as well as various department editors.
Non-traditional attendees such as librarians and office clerks may be
included. Therefore, the field of creativity is expanded and allows for a wider breadth of inputs
and ideas. Each of these members learns to team up and work across
departments to more fully develop stories that engage and answer readers' questions about
the story. The editing process has expanded and is no longer the sole province of various
editors.

This idea-group is [[concentric]] with the inner ring comprising the top editor, section editors,
star reporters and the known creative members of that media organization. The next ring will
comprise the copy editors, photographers, designers, graphic artists, newsroom librarians and
editorial assistants. The next ring extends to the staff members who are not in the newsroom
such as circulation, production and the pressroom. The final outer ring reaches readers and
reader advisory groups. The advisory groups provide background information and evaluate
coverage.

Idea-group meetings are short (15 to 20 minutes) and structured to have three rules: Story ideas
can be suggested by anyone for any reason; a person suggesting a story idea will not have to
be the one to write it; and there is no critiquing ideas, just listing ideas. Editors and decision-makers will determine the story list later and assign those stories to the best equipped staff.

The frequency of idea-group meetings, whether weekly or monthly, has no set rule. Meetings are held on days when the largest number of staff can attend.

'''2. The importance of coaching writers'''

The editor or assistant editor acts as the &quot;maestro&quot;
in development of a story and time-management of it after preliminary reporting. Preliminary reporting is complete when reporters know they have a story but are not clear on how best to tell it. A three-part test is applied while
brainstorming with the reporter in a “pre-maestro check” to see if the reporter is at a point
where he or she can summarize the essence of the story. To identify key reader questions, the editor
and reporter complete a 30-word summary of the story, a preliminary headline, an early draft of a lead and then they
isolate readers' top questions about that story.

This brainstorming session, or pre-maestro check, is the time where the editor will decide whether
to proceed with that story. If the pre-maestro check is successful, then a maestro session
will be called to include a photographer, copy editor and page designer.

A good maestro takes lots of notes from all the players during the development of the story package to make sure
good ideas do not disappear. Throughout this session, the editor asks questions instead of delivering orders.

'''3. The challenges of hurdling newsroom traditions'''

A lot of newsrooms run an [[assembly line]] approach to publication production where writers report to an editor to receive their assignments, write their articles, and then the editor creates photo assignments before the stories are ultimately compiled into a publication. Reporters traditionally follow three standard notions in an assembly-line approach to journalism. One, do all reporting before writing. Two, write the story, then discuss it with the editor. Three, don't write a headline, a copy editor will. The Maestro Concept challenges these notions and further challenges editors to be more successful by putting decision-making into the hands of those with the most expertise. For example, a photographer in a maestro session has more expertise about the best photo and does not need a photo assignment if he or she is involved early in the process.

The trick is detaching traditionalists from the journalist mindset and instead thinking and observing like the reader. Readers of a publication are seeing more than just a story. To them, a story is composed of everything on the page: photos, headlines, graphics, captions, and text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1PQTj4YFUT0C&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;dq=The+Editor's+Toolbox+Chapter+8+Maestro&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D-2gRtSVW4&amp;sig=gg7bn5hzCJ0yrnmCQCX9WsqdGK0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kq0cT_m0KMH5gge5r-X7CQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA |title=The Editor's Toolbox: A Reference Guide for Beginners and Professionals – Buck Ryan, Michael J. O'Donnell – Google Books |page=246 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal is to identify key reader questions and let them provide the framework for reporting and presentation of the story. Unlike the traditional approach where the answers to those questions lie in the text, answers to the key readers' questions go to high-visibility spots on the page, such as
photos, headlines, captions, and sidebar boxes and graphics. If the reader-friendly index is successful, the reader is hooked and reads through the story.

'''4. The maestro session in action'''

The maestro session is a 10- to 15-minute teamwork exercise that begins after the “pre-maestro check.”
The maestro session is where the key players involved in a story package (i.e. the reporter, the editor, the
photographer, the designer) sketch the presentation of the story before the writing is fleshed
out. This maestro session is led by the “maestro,” a senior editor or section editor. The key players draft headlines, the layout, arrange for the photo assignments, and establish deadlines and story lengths.

The maestro session itself will then focus on the quality of the story to ensure relevance to the readers. The focus is on quickly answering the top questions on a reader’s
mind. Quality is built into the story from the very beginning with teamwork instead of waiting
until the end to rely on inspection.

The maestro session has three core components and works consecutively down them, thereby
building quality along the way into these news stories. The concept is taught across the world
through the use of a story planning form and its process to “think like a reader.”
[[File:The Maestro Concept in action, &quot;Think Like a Reader&quot; Story Plan outline.png|thumb|right|alt=Think Like A Reader Story Plan.|Maestro concept story plan – think like a reader''.]]

:'''I.''' The first core component in the process is the “reader’s viewpoint” a.k.a. &quot;think like a reader.&quot;
::*First, essential questions that would immediately come to a reader’s mind in the story are asked 
::(these questions are answered in the high-visibility points on the page).
::*Second, the question is asked, “What is the single most important thing about the story?”
::*And finally, &quot;Is there any way readers can take action in response the story?&quot;

:'''II.''' The second core component involves picturing the story on the page and its high-visibility
: points in the layout, including graphics that will quickly attract a reader’s
:attention to the details of the story.
:Some of those integrated graphics that quickly tell the story are:
::*Quotation boxes
::*Question-and-answer boxes
::*Sidebar charts
::*Lists
::*Maps

:'''III.''' The third core component involves pulling all the parts of the team’s work together
:(photo, headline, graphics and writing) along with any design elements. This involves a sketch of the story package showing where the key readers' questions are answered on the page.

{{Quotation|''Getting the whole story: reporting and writing the news'' by Cheryl K. Gibbs and Tom Warhover:
* Some newspapers use a group brainstorming strategy called &quot;the maestro concept&quot; to plan stories and visual elements simultaneously. This approach was developed in the early 1990s by journalism professor Leland &quot;Buck&quot; Ryan in collaboration with journalists at the Logansport (Ind.) Pharos-Tribune. Editors, reporters, page designers, photographers and artists meet about individual stories, after enough reporting has been done to get a sense of them. In each story meeting, a person designated as the maestro uses a story planning format to help the group (1) think through questions readers would have about the story, (2) refine the story concept, (3) picture it on the page and (4) identify challenges. In picturing the story on the page, they consider what kinds of photographs and/or informational graphics might be appropriate, what kinds of sidebars or pullouts could be written, and whether series logos or other graphic elements will be needed. In these discussions, the journalists sometimes go so far as to sketch out possible page designs.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fisqzJm-8FsC&amp;q=maestro+concept#v=snippet&amp;q=maestro%20concept&amp;f=true |title= Getting the whole story: reporting and writing the news – Cheryl Gibbs and Tom Warhover |publisher=Google Books |page=225|accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''5. Lessons in critiquing'''

The maestro conducts follow ups or “audits” of the story package and asks for improved ideas and the story is fine-tuned.

Each reader question will be revisited to identify where it was answered. The goal is to answer the questions in the “high visibility” positions of the story page: the headlines, photos, information graphics and quotes. These high visibility spots are “hooks” which will pull the reader into the story to read it fully. If say, during this critique tally of five top reader questions, only three of the top readers’ questions are answered in these high visibility positions, that is a 60 percent efficiency rate. The team members will then ascertain why and how 5-out-of-5 questions could be answered. The goal is continuous improvement in identifying readers’ questions and answering them through page design and writing approaches.

The maestro concept respects the ability of journalists and team members to accurately list the top questions that readers would have of a story. Those &quot;Reader’s Viewpoints&quot; would then provide the framework for the reporting, graphics and design layout that successfully tell that story with the highest impact.

==Four-graph approach==

The four-graph approach to writing, editing, photography and design is meant to efficiently create an article designed for the reader. The design is partly based on the findings in the &quot;Eyes on the News&quot; study that found readers typically look at photos first, headlines second, captions third, and text fourth. The goal of this approach is to engage the readers by presenting the primary factual information.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

#Who? A photo or illustration shows the readers.
#What? A headline quickly gives reason to the visual.
#When and Where? A caption to further engage readers.
#The lead follows and eases the reader into the rest of story, summarizing in an [[Inverted Pyramid|inverted pyramid]] technique the who-what-when-where of journalism writing.

==Frequent mistakes==

Mistakes point out three key areas:
#Maestroing can be a big help or a big waste of time, depending on the participants' attention to detail and willingness to follow through on a maestro plan. The maestro needs to be a vigilant shepherd.
#Managing change is difficult enough without mistakes that demoralize participants and lead to a loss of confidence in the system.

==Benefits==

{{Quotation|Benefits

#Fewer rewrites. Writers and editors see less need to rewrite stories because of missing information or organization problems.
#Fewer unpublished photos. Photographers and photo editors see less need to reshoot photos, and clearer assignments reduce wasted time and effort.
#Cost-cutting. Mileage reimbursement checks dropped to $300 a month from $350 for photographers at the first paper to adopt the maestro concept.
#More camaraderie. Teamwork across sections and departments raises the respect for each other's contributions to the paper.
#Increase in awards. Typically, results can be seen from one year to the next where maestro sessions become daily events. The opposite also is true: as the number of maestro sessions decline, so do the awards.|The Editor’s Toolbox: A Reference Guide for Beginners and Professionals}}

{{Quotation|Baylor University ''Lariot Online'' student newspaper:
&quot;There is a maestro concept in journalism, like looking at art,&quot; Huett said. &quot;You look at stories and story ideas and then create a package.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baylor.edu/lariat/news.php?action=story&amp;story=13472 |title= BU journalists earn sweepstakes award – Amy Anthony |publisher=The Lariat Online |date= 1999-04-13|accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quotation|Kathy Silverberg, Executive Director of the ''Times Daily'':
&quot;The writer should have planned strategy with her editor before making the call. The Maestro concept works.&quot;

==Critiques==

The maestro plan is a cooperative editing plan to change the way newsrooms work. Not everyone agrees with the changes that are altering newsrooms.

{{Quotation|Reinventing the Newsroom:

::&quot;They're getting involved in all this hokey bullshit instead of putting out a hard-hitting newspaper,&quot; Schwartz contends. &quot;People are getting away from what really moves circulation, and that's news, stories that have gut appeal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reinventing&quot;/&gt;
}}

{{Quotation|American Copy Editors Society, Board Notes:

::&quot;... there’s always going to be turmoil in our industry. If it’s not the maestro concept or pagination, it’s readers’ short attention spans or the Internet.

The '''Hargeysa International Book Fair''' ('''HIBF''') ({{lang-so|''Bandhigga Caalamiga ah ee Buugaagta Hargeysa''}}) is an annual cultural event in the northwestern [[Somaliland]] region of [[Somalia]]. It is one of the largest public [[book fair]]s in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Every summer, HIBF brings writers, poets, artists and thinkers from Somaliland and from all over the world gather to share and discuss their art and literary productions with a wider audience. The main goal of the festival is to promote a culture of reading and writing in the region by producing and publishing high quality [[Somalian literature]] and translating international classical literature (including fiction, poetry and drama) into Somali. Organized by the Redsea Online Culture Foundation, the event aims to enable young people to access a range of cultural heritages, with the intention of stimulating the revival of all forms of art and human expression, including painting, poetry reciting, story-telling, drama composition and writing.

==History==
===Origins===
The Hargeysa International Book Fair was inaugurated in 2008 by [[Jama Musse Jama]], who serves as Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcement: 2010 Hargeysa International Book Fair (HIBF) 23rd of July to the 27th of July 2010 in Hargeysa|url=http://www.baadiya.com/View.aspx?ID=403|publisher=Baadiya|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Mary|title=SOMALILAND: The 5th Hargeisa International Book Fair is coming up!|url=http://somalilandpress.com/somaliland-the-5th-hargeisa-international-book-fair-is-coming-up-29645|accessdate=18 January 2014|newspaper=Somalilandpress|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grew from 200 to 10,000 participants over the following six years.

===Significance===
HIBF targets not only a young audience, but wider sectors of society. It aims to help foster cultural understanding, tolerance, democracy, and an appreciation of the diversity of Somali culture and literature. In the past few years, the Redsea Online Culture Foundation's festivals have served to raise the profile of reading and writing in the Somaliland region, and also unite youth from different provinces in the area. The main goal of the book fair is to promote critically thinking cultural and creative writing, to facilitate the habit of reading, to display books, from both local and writers abroad, to encourage members in the public to browse, read, engage with authors, serve as an inspiration to young people, and the wider society.

===Parallel events and joint ventures===
''Somaliland Moving Library'': The Moving Library Tour is the Book Fair's flagship outreach event. An exciting initiative, it takes place a week before the opening of the festival in Hargeisa and is held across all regions of Somaliland. It aims to bring the ethos and principles of the Book Fair – of citizenship and creative freedoms – closer to aspiring writers and readers outside of the city.

'''''Domesday Book''''' is the record of the great survey of England completed in 1086, executed for [[William I of England]]. This article is about the various ways [[Domesday Book]] was published, beginning in the 18th century. 

== From antiquarian beginnings ==
Domesday Book was an item of great interest to the antiquarian movement of the 18th century. This was the age of the [[English county histories|county history]], with many accounts of the English shires being published at this time, and Domesday Book, as a property record of early date that happened to be arranged by county, was a major source for the medieval history of all the counties encompassed by the survey. 

The reconstituted [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], founded in 1717 by [[Humfrey Wanley]], [[John Bagford]] and [[John Talman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rosemary |last=Sweet |title=Antiquaries: the Discovery of the Past in Eighteenth-Century Britain |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; made it part of its mission to work towards the publication of a wide variety of ancient records, including Domesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M.M. |last1=Condon |first2=E. |last2=Hallam |title=Government Printing of the Public Records in the Eighteenth Century |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=7 |year=1984 |pages=343–88, at p. 374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society struggled to achieve its aims, however, being afflicted by its members’ limited resources and sheer lack of enthusiasm.,&lt;ref&gt;Sweet 2004, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, after the purchase of a Royal Charter in 1751, the possibility of publishing Domesday became more realistic. In 1756 [[Philip Carteret Webb]] read a paper to the Society emphasising the great value of Domesday Book, and by implication the urgent need for a published edition: this paper was printed by the printing press of [[William Bowyer (printer)|William Bowyer]]. The following year, in response to Webb’s request, members reported back to the Society regarding existing printed and MS transcripts from Domesday Book, with the intention of compiling material that might be of assistance in the task of compiling an edition.&lt;ref&gt;Condon and Hallam 1984, pp. 374–5.&lt;/ref&gt; This effort did not bear fruit. 

In 1767, however, for reasons that may be connected to this renewal of interest in Domesday Book, plans were set in motion for the publication of a complete, scholarly edition of Domesday: this coincided with a programme of publication of other public records, including the [[Parliament Rolls]].&lt;ref&gt;Condon and Hallam 1984, pp. 363–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abraham Farley’s edition (1783) ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Farley Edition of Domesday.JPG|thumb|Cover of the Farley Edition]] --&gt;

In March 1767 [[Charles Morton (librarian)|Charles Morton]] (1716&amp;ndash;1799), a librarian at the British Museum, was put in charge of the scheme; a fact which caused resentment towards him from [[Abraham Farley]], a deputy chamberlain of the Exchequer who for many years had controlled access to [[Domesday Book]] in its repository at the [[Chapter House]], Westminster, and furthermore had been involved in the recent Parliament Rolls printing operation.&lt;ref&gt;Condon and Hallam 1984, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1768 Farley complained to the Treasury that he, not Morton, should be in charge of the project, while Morton, for his part, complained that he was being obstructed in his work by the staff at the Chapter House.&lt;ref&gt;Condon and Hallam 1984, pp. 376–77.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The government, meanwhile, had become concerned at the spiralling cost estimates – Morton indicated in 1770 that to continue would cost £4,525 on top of the £2,810 he had already spent. At this point, Farley was remembered, and he became co-editor of the work. Farley and Morton's rivalry precluded an enduring, constructive relationship, and after 1774 Farley was effectively in sole charge.&lt;ref&gt;Condon and Hallam 1984, p.378.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Farley pursued the task with a single-minded devotion born of long involvement with the public records, and Domesday Book in particular. One of his closest associates during the project was the printer [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]], inheritor of [[William Bowyer (printer)|William Bowyer's]] London printing press, who in 1773 had developed the [[typeface]] that was used in the published edition to represent as closely as possible the script in Domesday Book itself.&lt;ref&gt;Condon and Hallam 1984, pp. 378–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Farley's edition of Domesday was completed by 15 March 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Condon and Hallam 1984, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although of a high standard, Farley's work lacked supplementary material and indices. In 1800, therefore, the [[Record Commission]] ordered the printing of indexes to Farley's work. These were compiled under the direction of Sir [[Henry Ellis (librarian)|Henry Ellis]] and published in 1816, together with an edition of four &quot;satellite surveys&quot; &amp;ndash; the Exon Domesday, the ''[[Winton Domesday|Liber Winton]]'', the ''Inquisito Eliensis'' and the [[Boldon Book]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Ellis |editor-first=Henry |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |title=Libri Censualis, vocati Domesday-Book, Indices: accesit dissertatio generalis de ratione hujusce libri |year=1816 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Ellis |editor-first=Henry |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |title=Libri Censualis, vocati Domesday-Book, additamenta ex codic. antiquiss.: Exon’ Domesday, Inquisition Eliensis, Liber Winton’, Boldon Book |year=1816 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first complete publication of Domesday Book was a major step. However, the circulation of Farley's edition was so limited that it could not be truly accounted a work that significantly increased public access to Domesday Book. That was to take place only in 1861, with the production of the first photo-zincographic facsimile edition of Domesday.

== The photozincographic edition ==
{{main|Photozincography of the Domesday Book}}

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Inside of the photozincographed domesday book.JPG|thumb|Layout of the photozincographed edition of the Domesday Book {{deletable image-caption|Sunday, 19 December 2010|date=December 2010}}]] --&gt;
This process, which led to the publication in 1861, was the brainchild of Colonel [[Henry James (Ordnance Survey)|Henry James]], the Director General at the [[Ordnance Survey]]. The process involved the transferring of a photograph onto zinc or stone, which could then be used directly for printing or, alternatively, onto the waxed surface of a copper plate where the image formed a guide for engraving. It was a system that enabled [[facsimile]] reproduction en masse and thus, following a meeting with [[William Ewart Gladstone]] in 1859, in which James was allegedly asked by the then-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], whether he &quot;knew of any process by which some of our ancient manuscripts in the Record Office could be copied&quot;, James emphasised the superiority of this process over other reproductions, such as [[lithography]], which used heavy and brittle stone blocks and claimed that the process would be ideal for making cheap [[facsimile]] copies of Domesday Book.

In a letter to the assistant [[Secretary to the Treasury]], George Hamilton in October 1860, James outlined the cost of a complete reproduction of Domesday Book as an estimated £1575 for 500 copies or, alternatively, £3. 3s. per copy. James further outlined the cost of a single county to demonstrate the affordability of the process, using [[Cornwall]] as an example of one of the shorter entries in the volumes (eleven folio pages) and estimating the cost of 500 copies to be £11.&amp;nbsp;2s.&amp;nbsp;4d. On 14 January 1861, James was granted permission to photo-zincograph the Cornwall fragment of Domesday Book as a Treasury-funded experiment to determine the success of the process and, consequently, by 1863 the Ordnance Survey had photozincographed Domesday Book in its entirety, publishing it in thirty two county volumes.

The general public were excited about the invention of photo-zincography. Newspapers such as the ''Photographic News'' reported on the events surrounding the invention and even supplied their readers with an example of a document which had undergone the process.&lt;ref&gt;''The Photographic News'', vol. 3, no. 82, 30 March 1860, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications of Domesday since 1900 ==

The first two thirds of the 20th century saw little movement in the publications of Domesday Book. However as the 900th anniversary of the creation of Domesday came about interest was revived and major new editions began to emerge particularly the Alecto and Penguin editions. Later as the internet age began Domesday made the transition from paper to the web with commercial and academic projects like ‘Domesday Book Online and the Domesday Explorer’.

* Domesday Online

== The Phillimore Edition  ==

The Phillimore Edition is a dual Latin and English text edition of Greater Domesday Book, published in the 1970s by the local-history specialist publishers Phillimore &amp; Co under the general editorship of [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]]. Each county occupies a separate volume. The Latin text, printed on the left-hand pages, is a facsimile of Farley's edition; the translation, on the right-hand pages, was prepared by a team of volunteers, who (to ensure uniformity) worked within standardised guidelines for [[syntax]], [[punctuation]] and the rendering of proper names and technical terms. Each volume includes notes, tables of tenants' names and place-names, and a map. At the time of writing (July 2011) 29 volumes are still available.

== The Alecto Editions ==
[[Image:millenn.jpg|thumb|Alecto Millennium Edition binding]]

Published between 1985 and 1992 the Alecto Edition is the most complete [[facsimile]] of [[Domesday Book]] to date. There are three types of Alecto edition, the &quot;Penny Edition&quot;, the Millennium Edition and the Domesday Book Studies edition. It has been called an &quot;indecently exact facsimile&quot; by Professor [[Geoffrey Martin (historian)|Geoffrey Martin]], then Keeper of Public Records and custodian of the original Domesday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://addisonpublications.com/books/domesday.html Addison Publications: Domesday Book&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to produce this extremely high quality reproduction the original [[Domesday Book]] was unbound to allow each page to be photographed. The camera used for this process was the same size as a [[Ford Fiesta]] and for security reasons was only operated in a sealed cage. 

The Penny Edition was printed on a specialist paper made from cotton from the American [[Deep South]] so that it had the same weight and feel as the parchment of the original, although without the cost this implies. These pages were then bound between sheets of fifteenth century oak set with a silver penny of [[William I of England|William I]] and another 1986 [[Elizabeth II]] penny minted specially for the occasion. Because of the vast expense involved each copy of the Penny Edition cost £5750 and only 250 were produced.

The later Millennium Edition used the same high quality images and paper was bound into two volumes of calf skin in the style of the 12th century binding. This edition was accompanied by a volume of indices, a two volume English translation of the Latin and a box set of [[Ordnance Survey]] Maps with the Domesday sites overlaid on the modern maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://addisonpublications.com/books/dmillennium.html Addison Publications: Domesday Book: Millennium Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This edition was limited to 450 copies at a cost of £6750 for Greater Domesday and £5750 for Little Domesday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article836674.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12 Revealed: The inside story of the making of the Domesday Book &amp;ndash; Times Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library Version of Domesday once again used the same paper as the Penny and Millennium versions but was bound in a linen cover and boxed to provide durability over many years of use. This edition came with indices, translations and maps.

== The Penguin Edition ==
[[Image:Penguin Edition of Domesday Book.jpg|thumb|Cover of Penguin Edition (UK)]]
The Penguin Edition is based on the Alecto Edition and because of this follows the format of the original Domesday Book. Published in 2002 in hardback and in 2003 in paperback the Penguin is the first wholly English language edition of Domesday and also the first time Greater and Little Domesday have been bound together. As part of the [[Penguin Classics]] range Domesday Book joined hundreds of other books viewed as important to critics and public alike. The paperback was originally priced at £25 and keeps in line with Penguin’s principles of being affordable to all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/packages/uk/aboutus/history.html Penguin UK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book's introduction was written by [[Geoffrey Martin (historian)|Geoffrey Martin]], a former Keeper of the Public Records.

== Online editions of Domesday ==

'''Commercial copies'''&lt;br /&gt;
There are two main suppliers of commercial copies of Domesday, Domesday extracts.co.uk and [[The National Archives]] in London. Domesday extracts.co.uk provides six page extracts of the book for any town or village named.[http://www.domesdayextracts.co.uk/?de_affsrc=Domesdaybookcouk]  [[The National Archives]] will provide a PDF file of any page of Domesday Book for a fee.[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/domesday.asp]  These copies on request have been likened to the previous work done by scribes in legal disputes in the Middle Ages. 

'''The Domesday Explorer'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:Screen shot of the Domesday Explorer.JPG|thumb|Screen shot of the Domesday Explorer]]
The Domesday Explorer is made up of the entire Domesday Book in database form. It was built by Professor John Palmer and his son Matthew at the [[University of Hull]] using [[Microsoft Access]] as the platform between 1986 and 2008. The project was founded by the British [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] grant of £250 000 and is now available to the public free of charge from the [[University of Essex]] online data store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/feb/10/1 The holy grail of data: it's Domesday, online | Technology | The Observer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Explorer is a fully searchable data base and also includes stock charts of all the livestock in England in 1086 and statistics reports on each county of the survey. These were produced by Professor Palmer using the work of previous Domesday experts such as Ellis, Maitland and Finn. &lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:uni logo.jpg|thumb|Logo of the University of Hull (UK)]] --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4359">The '''title''' of a [[book]], or any other [[publishing|published]] text or [[work of art]], is a [[name]] for the work which is usually chosen by the [[author]]. A title can be used to identify the work, to place it in context, to convey a minimal summary of its contents, and to pique the reader's curiosity.

Some works supplement the title with a [[subtitle (titling)|subtitle]]. Texts without separate titles may be referred to by their [[incipit]], especially those produced before the practice of titling became popular. During development, a work may be referred to by a temporary [[working title]]. A piece of legislation may have both a [[short title]] and a [[long title]]. In [[library catalog]]ing, a [[uniform title]] is assigned to a work whose title is ambiguous.

In [[book design]], the title is typically shown on the [[spine (bookbinding)|spine]], the front [[book cover|cover]], and the [[title page]].

'''Jules-Romain Tardieu''' (28 January 1805 – 19 July 1868) was a [[French people|French]] writer, publisher and bookseller.

==Biography==

Jules-Romain Tardieu was born on 28 January 1805 in Rouen, son of the painter [[Jean-Charles Tardieu]].{{sfn|Travers|1874|p=311}}
At the age of sixteen he joined the house of [[Antoine-Augustin Renouard]].{{sfn|Travers|1874|p=312}}
In 1837 he became an associate of Jules Renouard, Antoine's son and successor.
When Jules Renouard died in 1854, he headed the publishing house for some time before founding another institution in 1856.

He was a member and secretary of several committees.
He put a lot of energy into questions of literary property, in which his brother [[Amand-Louis Tardieu]] was also involved in Belgium.{{sfn|Haynes|2010|p=299ff}}
Tardieu also became a well-known author under the pseudonyms &quot;J.-T. de Saint-Germain&quot; and &quot;abbé Paul&quot;.

He died on 19 July 1868 in Paris.

On March 13, 1876, a United States congressional resolution promoted gathering of local histories by communities to commemorate the centennial of independence. A number of publishers gathered these histories and recorded additional biographies to sell in most cases to the communities they described. These local histories now provide useful primary data for contemporary historians and genealogists.  The S. J. Clarke Publishing Company was a major contributor with scores of titles of the form &quot;A biographical Record of ...&quot; with the name of a county in Iowa, Illinois or Ohio appended. The company later extended to include locations as far away as California and British Columbia.

These books were commercial ventures whose customers were in most cases the subjects of the material in the books. As a consequence, the tone of the subject matter was generally upbeat and positive.

'''Benjamin White''' or '''Ben White''' (c. 1725 – March 9, 1794) was a successful Fleet Street publisher. He was the first publisher to specialise in books on [[Natural History]] including ''[[The Natural History of Selborne]]'' which was written by his brother, [[Gilbert White]].

==Life==
Benjamin White was the eldest son of John White (1688 - 1758), a barrister, and his wife Anne (born Holt). The White family lived at ''The Wakes'' the family home in [[Selborne]] which was to become a memorial to the White family. Ben attended school at [[Bishop's Waltham]] and he went to London to join the publishing business. He joined the publishing house led by John Whiston and he was a partner by 1756 and he led the firm by 1765.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;&gt;Paul F. S. Cornelius, ‘White, Benjamin (c.1725–1794)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/57016, accessed 12 Jan 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin White became the richest member of his family, but he is mainly remembered for introducing his younger brother [[Gilbert White]] to the barrister [[Daines Barrington]] and the naturalist [[Thomas Pennant]], their correspondence about the natural history of Selborne leading ultimately to Gilbert White's much admired ''[[The Natural History of Selborne]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;/&gt; White published a number of Pennant's books, including his ''British Zoology'' (1776–7).

The family connection was extended by Benjamin's brother John. John was chaplain to the garrison in [[Gibraltar]] and it is said that Gilbert's seventeen year encouragement of his brother John to document the natural history of the southern tip of Iberia led to Gilbert's decision to document Selborne's natural history. John had sent many specimens back to England for Gilbert to study.&lt;ref name=foster&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Paul|title=The Gibraltar collections: Gilbert White (1720–1793) and John White (1727–1780), and the naturalist and author Giovanni Antonio Scopoli (1723–1788) |volume=34|pages=30–46 |doi=10.3366/anh.2007.34.1.30 |issn=0260-9541}}&lt;/ref&gt; John was to prepare a book for publication when he returned to England but his brother Ben, and Gilbert who was also consulted, agreed to reject, ''Fauna Calpensis''. This is now a lost book.&lt;ref name=menez&gt;{{cite web|last=Menez|first=Alex|title=A History of Natural History in Gibraltar|url=http://www.gibmuseum.gi/Calpe_2009_files/Book%20of%20Abstracts%20-%20Final%20.pdf|work=Book of Abstracts from Calpe Conference|publisher=Gibraltar Museum|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The printing firm at the corner of [[Fleet Street]] and [[Strand, London|The Strand]] was known as ''Horace's Head''. It was the first to specialise in books on natural history and his publishing house became a meeting place for naturalists&lt;ref name=&quot;paul&quot;&gt;[http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/anh.1994.21.2.231 Benjamin White (1725–1794), his older brother Gilbert, and notes on the hibernation of swallows], Paul F. S. Cornelius, Archives of Natural History. Volume 21, Page 231-236 DOI 10.3366/anh.1994.21.2.231, ISSN 0260-9541, Available Online June 1994. &lt;/ref&gt; such as Thomas Pennant who had his books published by White.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;/&gt; He also published books on [[Conchology|Mollusc shells]] by [[Emanuel Mendez da Costa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22White%2C%20Benjamin%2C%20ca.%201724-1794%22 Benjamin White], books in the Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben's son, also Benjamin, joined the firm and he  was involved in publishing Gilbert's ''Selborne''. White died in [[Bentley, Hampshire]] having been a successful Fleet Street publisher. He never knew of the success of his brother Gilbert's book, as this started 30 years after his death when Natural History became fashionable.&lt;ref name=&quot;paul&quot;/&gt; The White family home in Selborne, ''The Wakes'', is preserved as a museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;&gt;[http://www.gilbertwhiteshouse.org.uk/ Gilbert White House], accessed January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rabbi Seymour Rossel''' (born August 9, 1945) is an American Jewish author, publisher, editor, educator, and founder of Rossel Books. Through his work in editing, writing, and publishing, he has influenced Jewish education and culture throughout the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;I. J. Carmin Karpman, ed., '''Who’s Who in World Jewry: A Biographical Dictionary of Outstanding Jews''' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Rossel was born on August 9, 1945 in Chicago, Illinois to renowned chef Willy Otto and Leona (Wadler). The family moved to Dallas, Texas in 1956. While a senior in high school, Rossel was selected to edit ''Whangdoodle'', the city-wide book review publication of the Young Adult department of the Dallas Public Library, where his writing was encouraged and tutored by famous children’s librarian and author, Siddie Joe Johnson.

He received a B.A. in History with a Minor in Education from [[Southern Methodist University]] in Dallas, TX in 1968. He became editor of the SMU literary journal, ''Espejo'', in which his award-winning short stories had previously appeared. Under the tutelage of Texas author Marshall Terry, he entered the Book of the Month Club Writing Fellowship Awards, becoming a Southwest Regional Finalist for his story &quot;The Demonstration&quot; which was subsequently published in a Doubleday anthology of young authors entitled, ''Growing Up in America''.

He received his M. A. in 1978 from New York University School of Education, Institute of Hebrew Culture, where he studied Bible and archaeology with Dr. [[Cyrus H. Gordon|Cyrus Gordon]]. His post-graduate work included studies in education under Dr. Henry J. Perkinson and studies in mythology and world religions under Dr. [[Joseph Campbell]].

He became a Fellow in Religious Education (F.R.E), NATE in 1982, and a Reform Jewish Educator (R.J.E.), URJ (UAHC) &amp; HUC-JIR in 1988.

Rossel was ordained as a Rabbi in 2000 in New York, by the Westchester Beit Din, sponsored by Rabbis Chaim Stern, Manuel Gold, and Shoshana Hantman.

Rossel married Jewish educator Sharon L. Wechter in 1999. Of his four children, two (Rabbi Amy Rossel Ross and Rabbi Rachel Maimin) have been ordained by the HUC-JIR and are serving congregations in the Reform movement. His daughter Deborah Rossel Bradford was a Student Laureate Poet for the State of Connecticut and his son Benjamin Maimin is Vice-President of Columbia Artists Management, Inc. (CAMI).

==Professional==
Rossel is presently publisher of Rossel Books, CEO of Rossel Counseling and Consulting, Inc. and Director of Pathways Foundation. He lectures on Bible and Jewish subjects at the Women's Institute of Houston,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wih.org/faculty/seymour-rossel/ The Women's Institute of Houston Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to conduct workshops in education and scholar-in-residence appearances for Jewish federations and synagogues.

===Publishing career===
Rossel's work as a Jewish publisher began when he was hired to serve as Executive Editor (later, Executive Vice-President) of [[Behrman House]], Inc., in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Madison, ''Jewish Publishing in America: The Impact of Jewish Writing on American Culture'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; His editorial work, guided by Jacob Behrman and [[Eugene Borowitz|Eugene B. Borowitz]], resulted in the textbooks and guides for teachers that formed the backbone of present Jewish curriculum in the Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist movements throughout the English-speaking world.

His aspiration to bring modern scholarship into the classrooms of Jewish religious schools led to publications of student versions of [[Amos Elon]]'s ''Israelis: Founders and Sons''; [[Lucy Dawidowicz]]’s ''The War Against the Jews'', [[Abba Eban]]'s, ''My People'', and a series of books on Talmud and Midrash written by [[Jacob Neusner]] and edited by Dr. David Altshuler.

To serve the needs of high school and adult studies in the Jewish community, he founded The Jewish Concepts and Issues series, commissioning and publishing ''Judaism and the New Woman'' by the first female rabbi, [[Sally Priesand]], ''The Russian Jewry Reader'' by [[Evan Chesler]], and ''Anti-Semitism in Europe: Sources of the Holocaust'' edited by David Zisenwine.

For adult studies, he issued a series of original and reprint editions of [[Louis Jacobs]]' ''A Jewish Theology'', [[Meyer Levin]]'s ''Eva: A Novel of the Holocaust'', [[Jiri Langer]]'s ''Nine Gates to the Chassidic Mysteries'', and Rachmil Bryk’s ''Kiddush HaShem'' (''A Cat in the Ghetto'').

Leaving Behrman House in 1981, he founded Rossel Books, Inc. In a time when few of the major trade publishers were willing to invest in works directed to the needs of the American Jewish community, Rossel published a series of influential books including the first book on the Holocaust specifically directed to young children, ''Promise of a New Spring'' by Holocaust survivor and author [[Gerda Klein|Gerda Weissman Klein]]; the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]'s ''Genocide'', critical issues of the Holocaust: A companion to the film, Genocide; ''Tzedakah'' by Jacob Neusner; ''The Bar Kokhba Syndrome: Risk and Realism in International Relations'' by Yehoshafat Harkabi; ''Contemporary Jewish Education: Issachar American Style'' by Alvin Schiff; ''Creative Jewish Education: A Reconstructionist Perspective'', edited by [[Jacob Staub]]; and ''Gates of Freedom: A Passover Haggadah'' by Chaim Stern.

In recent years, Rossel has resumed publishing through Rossel Books, notably producing ''Paths of Faith: The New Jewish Prayer Book for Synagogue and Home : For Weekdays, Shabbat, Festivals &amp; Other Occasions'' by Chaim Stern; ''The New Family Prayerbook'' by [[Sheldon Zimmerman]]; ''Reinventing Adult Jewish Education'' by Betsy Dolgin Katz; ''The Unity Principle: The Shaping of Jewish History'' by Ellis Rivkin; and ''Bible Dreams: The Spiritual Quest: How the Dreams in the Bible Speak to Us Today'' (Revised 2nd Edition) by Rossel himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curledup.com/bibledre.htm Curled Up With a Good Book Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to 1997, Rossel served as Publisher for the American Reform movement (URJ, formerly UAHC), where he directed the press to a round of new publishing that including several important contributions in Jewish education and Jewish interfaith work, notably ''A Congregation of Learners: Transforming the Synagogue into a Learning Community'' (edited by Sara Lee, Seymour Rossel, and Isa Aron), ''What Crucified Jesus?: Messianism, Pharisaism, and the Development of Christianity'' by Ellis Rivkin, and ''The Haftarah Commentary'' by [[W. Gunther Plaut]] and Chaim Stern.

==Career in Jewish Education==
Rossel served as Lecturer in Education at [[Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]] from 1973 to 1985 when he became Dean of the School of Education of HUC-JIR, New York campus. He served as Curriculum Expert for the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] (1984-1985) and as National Director of Gesher LeKesher, a program for teenage Jewish education, from 1988-1989. After his temporary relocation to Texas, he was Headmaster of the Solomon Schechter Academy of Dallas, Texas (1991-1992) before being called back to New York to serve as Director of the National Department of Education of the Reform movement (URJ) and Director of the combined Commission on Reform Jewish Education of the CCAR, URJ, and NATE (1993-1996).

Devoted to Jewish teacher education, Rossel was a co-founder of the [[Coalition for the Advancement of Jewish Education]] (CAJE), serving for many years on its executive board and once as its Vice Chairperson. He was the Chairperson of its two international conferences, CAJE 13 (1988) and CAJE 21 (1996), both convened at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1976, he sponsored the appearance of legendary folk-singer and composer [[Debbie Friedman]] at the CAJE conference at Rutgers University which first brought her to the attention of the national Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/caje CAJE] Jewish Women's Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

He was called to serve as Rabbi of Congregation Jewish Community North of Spring, Texas from 2005-2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cjcn.org/content/view/595/31/ 3 Rabbis and a Challah]&lt;/ref&gt;

Seymour lectures widely on [[Israel]], [[Holocaust]], Bible, archaeology, spirituality, Jewish history and Jewish education. He is known for many appearances as scholar-in-residence; teacher, board, and congregational workshop leader; and guest lecturer for Bureaus and Federations in communities throughout North America.

==Books==
Rossel is the author of 36 books including ''A Child’s Bible'' (2 volumes); ''The Essential Jewish Stories: God, Torah, Israel and Faith'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishbookreview.wordpress.com/tag/seymour-rossel/ Jewish Book Review]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Torah: Portion-by-Portion''; ''Managing the Jewish Classroom: How to Transform Yourself Into a Master Teacher''; ''Let Freedom Ring: The Jews of America''; ''A Thousand and One Chickens''; ''When a Jew Prays'', and ''When a Jew Seeks Wisdom: The Sayings of the Fathers.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/186837.Seymour_Rossel Seymour Rossel Bibliography on GoodReads]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has edited more than 300 books, working with many distinguished Jewish authors. For nearly twenty years, he served on the Executive Board of the [[Jewish Book Council]] of America.

==Life and career==
Reeve was born in Philadelphia, the son of Anne Conrad D'Olier and Richard Henry Reeve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wargs.com/other/reeve.html Ancestry of Christopher Reeve]&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought up outside New York City. Reeve worked in the wheat fields for a while during college and, after graduation, was a Hudson River longshoreman for a while.  He graduated from [[Princeton University]] (1950) and [[Columbia University]] (1958), and in 1961 was one of the first exchanges between the American Council of Learned Societies and the USSR Academy of Sciences. In the late summer of 1962 he accompanied [[Robert Frost]] to [[Russia]] for his meeting with [[Nikita Khrushchev]], where Reeve served as Frost's translator.

Reeve started his academic career teaching Russian language and literature at [[Columbia University]].  After teaching at Columbia, Reeve moved to [[Wesleyan University]] in 1962 as chairman of the Russian Department.  In 1967, he joined Wesleyan's inter-disciplinary College of Letters where he taught literature, humanities and creative writing until his retirement in 2002.  During the course of his career he had visiting appointments at [[Oxford University]], [[Yale University|Yale]], and Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/archives/fdreeve_bluecat08.html F. D. Reeve and The Three Blue Cats jazz band]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1994 he lived in [[Wilmington, Vermont]] with his wife the novelist Laura Stevenson.  Reeve was an officer of the [[Poetry Society of America]], the founding editor of ''&quot;Poetry Review,&quot;'' the secretary of [[Poets House]] in its formative years, and was associated with the New England Poetry Club and the [[New York Quarterly]].  He published over two dozen books of poetry, fiction, criticism, and translation.

Reeve died on June 28, 2013 at Dartmouth Hitchcock Hospital in [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]] from complications from [[diabetes]]. He was 84 and is survived by his fourth wife, Laura C. Stevenson, a novelist: his son Benjamin; a daughter, Alya, and two sons, Brock and Mark, all from his second marriage; two stepdaughters, Katharine O’Connell and Margaret Staloff; his sister, Anne Reeve Childs; his brother, Richard; and 18 grandchildren.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;
